21 when mulk mountynotty man was everybully and the first leal7
21 ribberrobber that ever had her ainway everybuddy to his love-8
21 saking eyes and everybilly lived alove with everybiddy else, and9
21 Jarl van Hoother had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse,10
21 laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins11
21 of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy12
21 on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh, castle and earthenhouse.13
21 And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn only the niece-14
21 of-his-in-law, the prankquean. And the prankquean pulled a rosy15
21 one and made her wit foreninst the dour. And she lit up and fire-16
21 land was ablaze. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusi-17
21 enne: Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike a poss of porter-18
21 pease? And that was how the skirtmisshes began. But the dour19
21 handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut! So her grace20
21 o'malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shan-21
21 dy westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Hoother war-22
21 lessed after her with soft dovesgall: Stop deef stop come back to23
21 my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud. And there24
21 was a brannewail that same sabboath night of falling angles some-25
21 where in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years'26
21 walk in Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the love-27
21 spots off the jiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her28
21 four owlers masters for to tauch him his tickles and she convor-29
21 ted him to the onesure allgood and he became a luderman. So then30
21 she started to rain and to rain and, be redtom, she was back again31
21 at Jarl van Hoother's in a brace of samers and the jiminy with32
21 her in her pinafrond, lace at night, at another time. And where33
21 did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And Jarl von Hoo-34
21 ther had his baretholobruised heels drowned in his cellarmalt,35
21 shaking warm hands with himself and the jimminy Hilary and36
22 the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet,1
22 wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prank-2
22 quean nipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flack-3
22 ering from the hillcombs. And she made her witter before the4
22 wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why do I am alook alike two poss5
22 of porterpease? And: Shut! says the wicked, handwording her6
22 madesty. So her madesty 'a forethought' set down a jiminy and7
22 took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman's Land she8
22 rain, rain, rain. And Jarl von Hoother bleethered atter her with9
22 a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop.10
22 But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it. And there was a wild11
22 old grannewwail that laurency night of starshootings somewhere12
22 in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years' walk in13
22 Turnlemeem and she punched the curses of cromcruwell with14
22 the nail of a top into the jiminy and she had her four larksical15
22 monitrix to touch him his tears and she provorted him to the16
22 onecertain allsecure and he became a tristian. So then she started17
22 raining, raining, and in a pair of changers, be dom ter, she was18
22 back again at Jarl von Hoother's and the Larryhill with her under19
22 her abromette. And why would she halt at all if not by the ward20
22 of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the third charm?21
22 And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his pantry-22
22 box, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare! O dare!), ant23
22 the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the24
22 watercloth, kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like25
22 knavepaltry and naivebride and in their second infancy. And the26
22 prankquean picked a blank and lit out and the valleys lay twink-27
22 ling. And she made her wittest in front of the arkway of trihump,28
22 asking: Mark the Tris, why do I am alook alike three poss of por-29
22 ter pease? But that was how the skirtmishes endupped. For like30
22 the campbells acoming with a fork lance of-lightning, Jarl von31
22 Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror of the dames, came32
22 hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway of his33
22 three shuttoned castles, in his broadginger hat and his civic chol-34
22 lar and his allabuff hemmed and his bullbraggin soxangloves35
22 and his ladbroke breeks and his cattegut bandolair and his fur-36
23 framed panuncular cumbottes like a rudd yellan gruebleen or-1
23 angeman in his violet indigonation, to the whole longth of the2
23 strongth of his bowman's bill. And he clopped his rude hand to3
23 his eacy hitch and he ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to4
23 shut up shop, dappy. And the duppy shot the shutter clup (Per-5
23 kodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlayorgromgremmitghundhurth-6
23 rumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!) And they all drank7
23 free. For one man in his armour was a fat match always for any8
23 girls under shurts. And that was the first peace of illiterative9
23 porthery in all the flamend floody flatuous world. How kirssy the10
23 tiler made a sweet unclose to the Narwhealian captol. Saw fore11
23 shalt thou sea. Betoun ye and be. The prankquean was to hold12
23 her dummyship and the jimminies was to keep the peacewave13
23 and van Hoother was to git the wind up. Thus the hearsomeness14
23 of the burger felicitates the whole of the polis.15

26 Hep, hep, hurrah there! Hero! Seven times thereto we salute9

26 was keng and his members met in the Diet of Man. The same29
26 shop slop in the window. Jacob's lettercrackers and Dr Tipple's30
26 Vi-Cocoa and the Eswuards' desippated soup beside Mother Sea-31
26 gull's syrup. Meat took a drop when Reilly-Parsons failed. Coal's32

27 Essie in our Luna's Convent? They called her Holly Merry her15
27 lips were so ruddyberry and Pia de Purebelle when the redminers16
27 riots was on about her. Were I a clerk designate to the Williams-17

28 hands were employed so she never knew was she on land or at14
28 sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger's bride. She15
28 was flirtsome then and she's fluttersome yet. She can second a16

69 pence, to grow old and happy (hogg it and kidd him) for the re-19
69 minants of his years; and when everything was got up for the20
69 purpose he put an applegate on the place by no means as some21
69 pretext a bedstead in loo thereof to keep out donkeys (the pig-22
69 dirt hanging from the jags to this hour makes that clear) and just23
69 thenabouts the iron gape, by old custom left open to prevent24
69 the cats from getting at the gout, was triplepatlockt on him on25
69 purpose by his faithful poorters to keep him inside probably and26
69 possibly enaunter he felt like sticking out his chest too far and27

69       O, by the by, lets wee brag of praties, it ought to be always 30
69 remembered in connection with what has gone before that there31
69 was a northroomer, Herr Betreffender, out for his zimmer hole-32
69 digs, digging in number 32 at the Rum and Puncheon (Branch of33
69 Dirty Dick's free house) in Laxlip (where the Sockeye Sammons34

81 him, catching holst of an oblong bar he had and with which he31
81 usually broke furnitures he rose the stick at him. The boarder32

81 noistre the general Boukeleff, man may not say), struggled35
81 apairently for some considerable time, (the cradle rocking equally36
82 to one and oppositely from the other on its law of capture and1
82 recapture), under the All In rules around the booksafe, fighting2
82 like purple top and tipperuhry Swede, (Secremented Servious of3
82 the Divine Zeal!) and in the course of their tussle the toller man,4
82 who had opened his bully bowl to beg, said to the miner who5
82 was carrying the worm (a handy term for the portable distillery6
82 which consisted of three vats, two jars and several bottles though7
82 we purposely say nothing of the stiff, both parties having an8
82 interest in the spirits): Let me go, Pautheen! I hardly knew ye.9
82 Later on, after the solstitial pause for refleshmeant, the same10

82 so, he would pay him back the six vics odd, do you see, out of27
82 that for what was taken on the man of samples last Yuni or Yuly,28
82 do you follow me, Capn? To this the other, Billi with the Boule,29
82 who had mummed and mauled up to that (for he was hesitency30
82 carried to excelcism) rather amusedly replied: Woowoo would31
82 you be grossly surprised, Hill, to learn that, as it so happens, I32
82 honestly have not such a thing as the loo, as the least chance of33
82 a tinpanned crackler anywhere about me at the present moho-34

87 hatinaring, rowdy O, which, with the jiboulees of Juno and the5
87 dates of ould lanxiety, was going, please the Rainmaker, to6
87 decembs within the ephemerides of profane history, all one with7
87 Tournay, Yetstoslay and Temorah, and one thing which would8
87 pigstickularly strike a person of such sorely tried observational9
87 powers as Sam, him and Moffat, though theirs not to reason why,10
87 the striking thing about it was that he was patrified to see, hear,11
87 taste and smell, as his time of night, how Hyacinth O'Donnell,12
87 B.A., described in the calendar as a mixer and wordpainter, with13
87 part of a sivispacem (Gaeltact for dungfork) on the fair green14

87 O'Crian, Jr., both changelings, unlucalised, of no address and18
87 in noncommunicables, between him and whom, ever since wal-19
87 lops before the Mise of Lewes, bad blood existed on the ground20
87 of the boer's trespass on the bull or because he firstparted his21
87 polarbeeber hair in twoways, or because they were creepfoxed22
87 andt grousuppers over a nippy in a noveletta, or because they23
87 could not say meace, (mute and daft) meathe. The litigants, he24
87 said, local congsmen and donalds, kings of the arans and the dalk-25
87 eys, kings of mud and tory, even the goat king of Killorglin,26
87 were egged on by their supporters in the shape of betterwomen27
87 with bowstrung hair of Carrothagenuine ruddiness, waving crim-28
87 son petties and screaming from Isod's towertop. There were29
87 cries from the thicksets in court and from the macdublins on the30
87 bohernabreen of: Mind the bank from Banagher, Mick, sir! Pro-31
87 dooce O'Donner. Ay! Exhibit his relics! Bu! Use the tongue32

87 when and where that knife of knifes the treepartied ambush was35
87 laid (roughly spouting around half hours 'twixt dusk in dawn,36

88 was not as much light from the widowed moon as would dim a3
88 child's altar. The mixer, accordingly, was bluntly broached, and4
88 in the best basel to boot, as to whether he was one of those5
88 lucky cocks for whom the audible-visible-gnosible-edible world6

89 And both as like as a duel of lentils? Peacisely. So he was pelted4

90 your brother? Obsolutely. And if it was all about that, egregious20
90 sir? About that and the other. If he was not alluding to the whole21
90 in the wall? That he was when he was not eluding from the whole22
90 of the woman. Briefly, how such beginall finally struck him now?23
90 Like the crack that bruck the bank in Multifarnham. Whether he24

94 it. Wave bore it. Reed wrote of it. Syce ran with it. Hand tore6
94 it and wild went war. Hen trieved it and plight pledged peace.7
94 It was folded with cunning, sealed with crime, uptied by a harlot,8

94 were no more of them. So pass the push for port sake. Be it soon.32
94 Ah ho! And do you remember, Singabob, the badfather, the33
94 same, the great Howdoyoucallem, and his old nickname, Dirty34

95 he caught his paper dispillsation from the poke, old Minace and1

95 putting out her netherlights, and I'd sooner one precious sip at24
95 your pure mountain dew than enrich my acquaintance with that25

149        Talis is a word often abused by many passims (I am working 34
149 out a quantum theory about it for it is really most tantumising35

152 expletive method which I frequently use when I have to sermo7
152 with muddlecrass pupils. Imagine for my purpose that you are a8
152 squad of urchins, snifflynosed, goslingnecked, clothyheaded,9
152 tangled in your lacings, tingled in your pants, etsitaraw etcicero.10
152 And you, Bruno Nowlan, take your tongue out of your inkpot!11

152 and lubberds!17
152        Eins within a space and a wearywide space it wast ere wohned 18
152 a Mookse. The onesomeness wast alltolonely, archunsitslike,19
152 broady oval, and a Mookse he would a walking go (My hood!20
152 cries Antony Romeo),so one grandsumer evening, after a great21
152 morning and his good supper of gammon and spittish, having22
152 flabelled his eyes, pilleoled his nostrils, vacticanated his ears and23
152 palliumed his throats, he put on his impermeable, seized his im-24
152 pugnable, harped on his crown and stepped out of his immobile25
152 De Rure Albo (socolled becauld it was chalkfull of masterplasters26
152 and had borgeously letout gardens strown with cascadas, pinta-27
152 costecas, horthoducts and currycombs) and set off from Luds-28
152 town a spasso to see how badness was badness in the weirdest of29
152 all pensible ways.30
152        As he set off with his father's sword, his lancia spezzata, he was 31
152 girded on, and with that between his legs and his tarkeels, our32
152 once in only Bragspear, he clanked, to my clinking, from veetoes33
152 to threetop, every inch of an immortal.34
152        He had not walked over a pentiadpair of parsecs from his 35
152 azylium when at the turning of the Shinshone Lanteran near36
153 Saint Bowery's-without-his-Walls he came (secunding to the one1
153 one oneth of the propecies, Amnis Limina Permanent) upon the2
153 most unconsciously boggylooking stream he ever locked his3
153 eyes with. Out of the colliens it took a rise by daubing itself Ni-4
153 non. It looked little and it smelt of brown and it thought in nar-5
153 rows and it talked showshallow. And as it rinn it dribbled like any6
153 lively purliteasy: My, my, my!  Me and me!  Little down dream7
153 don't I love thee!8
153        And, I declare, what was there on the yonder bank of the 9
153 stream that would be a river, parched on a limb of the olum, bolt10
153 downright, but the Gripes? And no doubt he was fit to be dried11
153 for why had he not been having the juice of his times?12
153        His pips had been neatly all drowned on him; his polps were 13
153 charging odours every older minute; he was quickly for getting14
153 the dresser's desdaign on the flyleaf of his frons; and he was15
153 quietly for giving the bailiff's distrain on to the bulkside of his16
153 cul de Pompe. In all his specious heavings, as be lived by Opti-17
153 mus Maximus, the Mookse had never seen his Dubville brooder-18
153 on-low so nigh to a pickle.19

153 yea broader he betaught of it, the fetter, the summe and the haul31

153 allnight sitting to Lio the Faultyfindth.34
153                Good appetite us, sir Mookse! How do you do it? cheeped 35
153 the Gripes in a wherry whiggy maudelenian woice and the jack-36
154 asses all within bawl laughed and brayed for his intentions for1
154 they knew their sly toad lowry now. I am rarumominum blessed2

154        Think of it! O miserendissimest retempter! A Gripes! 6

154 Gather behind me, satraps! Rots!13
154                I am till infinity obliged with you, bowed the Gripes, his 14
154 whine having gone to his palpruy head. I am still always having15
154 a wish on all my extremities. By the watch, what is the time, pace?16
154        Figure it! The pining peever! To a Mookse! 17
154                Ask my index, mund my achilles, swell my obolum, wosh- 18
154 up my nase serene, answered the Mookse, rapidly by turning19
154 clement, urban, eugenious and celestian in the formose of good20
154 grogory humours. Quote awhore? That is quite about what I21
154 came on my missions with my intentions laudibiliter to settle with22
154 you, barbarousse. Let thor be orlog. Let Pauline be Irene. Let23
154 you be Beeton. And let me be Los Angeles. Now measure your24

154 you give you up? Como? Fuert it?27
154        Sancta Patientia! You should have heard the voice that an- 28

154                I was just thinkling upon that, swees Mooksey, but, for all 30
154 the rime on my raisins, if I connow make my submission, I can-31
154 nos give you up, the Gripes whimpered from nethermost of his32

157        Nuvoletta in her lightdress, spunn of sisteen shimmers, was 8
157 looking down on them, leaning over the bannistars and listening9
157 all she childishly could. How she was brightened when Should-10
157 rups in his glaubering hochskied his welkinstuck and how she11
157 was overclused when Kneesknobs on his zwivvel was makeact-12
157 ing such a paulse of himshelp! She was alone. All her nubied13
157 companions were asleeping with the squirrels. Their mivver,14
157 Mrs Moonan, was off in the Fuerst quarter scrubbing the back-15
157 steps of Number 28. Fuvver, that Skand, he was up in Norwood's16
157 sokaparlour, eating oceans of Voking's Blemish. Nuvoletta lis-17
157 tened as she reflected herself, though the heavenly one with his18
157 constellatria and his emanations stood between, and she tried all19
157 she tried to make the Mookse look up at her (but he was fore too20
157 adiaptotously farseeing) and to make the Gripes hear how coy21
157 she could be (though he was much too schystimatically auricular22
157 about his ens to heed her) but it was all mild's vapour moist. Not23
157 even her feignt reflection, Nuvoluccia, could they toke their24
157 gnoses off for their minds with intrepifide fate and bungless25
157 curiasity, were conclaved with Heliogobbleus and Commodus26
157 and Enobarbarus and whatever the coordinal dickens they did27
157 as their damprauch of papyrs and buchstubs said. As if that was28
157 their spiration! As if theirs could duiparate her queendim! As if29
157 she would be third perty to search on search proceedings! She30
157 tried all the winsome wonsome ways her four winds had taught31
157 her. She tossed her sfumastelliacinous hair like le princesse de la32
157 Petite Bretagne and she rounded her mignons arms like Mrs33
157 Cornwallis-West and she smiled over herself like the beauty of34
157 the image of the pose of the daughter of the queen of the Em-35
157 perour of Irelande and she sighed after herself as were she born36
158 to bride with Tristis Tristior Tristissimus. But, sweet madonine,1
158 she might fair as well have carried her daisy's worth to Florida.2
158 For the Mookse, a dogmad Accanite, were not amoosed and the3
158 Gripes, a dubliboused Catalick, wis pinefully obliviscent.4
158        I see, she sighed. There are menner. 5
158        The siss of the whisp of the sigh of the softzing at the stir of 6
158 the ver grose O arundo of a long one in midias reeds: and shades7
158 began to glidder along the banks, greepsing, greepsing, duusk8
158 unto duusk, and it was as glooming as gloaming could be in the9
158 waste of all peacable worlds. Metamnisia was allsoonome coloro-10
158 form brune; citherior spiane an eaulande, innemorous and un-11
158 numerose. The Mookse had a sound eyes right but he could not12
158 all hear. The Gripes had light ears left yet he could but ill see.13
158 He ceased. And he ceased, tung and trit, and it was neversoever14
158 so dusk of both of them. But still Moo thought on the deeps of15
158 the undths he would profoundth come the morrokse and still16
158 Gri feeled of the scripes he would escipe if by grice he had luck17
158 enoupes.18
158        Oh, how it was duusk! From Vallee Maraia to Grasyaplaina, 19
158 dormimust echo! Ah dew! Ah dew! It was so duusk that the20
158 tears of night began to fall, first by ones and twos, then by threes21
158 and fours, at last by fives and sixes of sevens, for the tired ones22
158 were wecking, as we weep now with them.  O! O! O! Par la23
158 pluie!24
158        Then there came down to the thither bank a woman of no 25
158 appearance (I believe she was a Black with chills at her feet) and26
158 she gathered up his hoariness the Mookse motamourfully where27
158 he was spread and carried him away to her invisible dwelling,28
158 thats hights, Aquila Rapax, for he was the holy sacred solem and29
158 poshup spit of her boshop's apron. So you see the Mookse he30
158 had reason as I knew and you knew and he knew all along. And31
158 there came down to the hither bank a woman to all important32
158 (though they say that she was comely, spite the cold in her heed)33
158 and, for he was as like it as blow it to a hawker's hank, she34
158 plucked down the Gripes, torn panicky autotone, in angeu from35
158 his limb and cariad away its beotitubes with her to her unseen36
159 shieling, it is, De Rore Coeli. And so the poor Gripes got wrong;1
159 for that is always how a Gripes is, always was and always will be.2
159 And it was never so thoughtful of either of them. And there were3
159 left now an only elmtree and but a stone. Polled with pietrous,4
159 Sierre but saule. O! Yes! And Nuvoletta, a lass.5
159        Then Nuvoletta reflected for the last time in her little long life 6
159 and she made up all her myriads of drifting minds in one. She7
159 cancelled all her engauzements. She climbed over the bannistars;8
159 she gave a childy cloudy cry: Nuée!  Nuée!  A lightdress fluttered.9
159 She was gone. And into the river that had been a stream (for a10
159 thousand of tears had gone eon her and come on her and she was11
159 stout and struck on dancing and her muddied name was Missis-12
159 liffi) there fell a tear, a singult tear, the loveliest of all tears (I13
159 mean for those crylove fables fans who are 'keen' on the pretty-14
159 pretty commonface sort of thing you meet by hopeharrods) for it15
159 was a leaptear. But the river tripped on her by and by, lapping16
159 as though her heart was brook: Why, why, why! Weh, O weh!17
159 I'se so silly to be flowing but I no canna stay!18
159        No applause, please! Bast! The romescot nattleshaker will go 19

163 theory, has been carefully digesting the very wholesome criticism36
164 I helped him to in my princeps edition which is all so munch1
164 to the cud) are mutuearly polarised the incompatabilily of any2
164 delusional acting as ambivalent to the fixation of his pivotism.3
164 Positing, as above, too males pooles, the one the pictor of the4
164 other and the omber the Skotia of the one, and looking want-5
164 ingly around our undistributed middle between males we feel6
164 we must waistfully woent a female to focus and on this stage7
164 there pleasantly appears the cowrymaid M. whom we shall8
164 often meet below who introduces herself upon us at some precise9
164 hour which we shall again agree to call absolute zero or the10
164 babbling pumpt of platinism. And so like that former son11
164 of a kish who went up and out to found his farmer's ashes we12
164 come down home gently on our own turnedabout asses to meet13
164 Margareen.14
164        We now romp through a period of pure lyricism of shame- 15
164 bred music (technologically, let me say, the appetising entry of16
164 this subject on a fool chest of vialds is plumply pudding the carp17
164 before doevre hors) evidenced by such words in distress as I18
164 cream for thee, Sweet Margareen, and the more hopeful O Mar-19
164 gareena! O Margareena! Still in the bowl is left a lump of gold!20
164 (Correspondents, by the way, will keep on asking me what is the21
164 correct garnish to serve drisheens with. Tansy Sauce. Enough).22
164 The pawnbreaking pathos of the first of these shoddy pieces23
164 reveals it as a Caseous effort. Burrus's bit is often used for a toast.24
164 Criniculture can tell us very precisely indeed how and why this25
164 particular streak of yellow silver first appeared on (not in) the26
164 bowel, that is to see, the human head, bald, black, bronze, brown,27
164 brindled, betteraved or blanchemanged where it might be use-28
164 fully compared with an earwig on a fullbottom. I am offering29
164 this to Signorina Cuticura and I intend to take it up and bring it30
164 under the nosetice of Herr Harlene by way of diverting his31
164 attentions. Of course the unskilled singer continues to pervert32
164 our wiser ears by subordinating the space-element, that is to33
164 sing, the aria, to the time-factor, which ought to be killed, ill34
164 tempor. I should advise any unborn singer who may still be35
164 among my heeders to forget her temporal diaphragm at home36
165 (the best thing that could happen to it!) and attack the roulade1
165 with a swift colpo di glottide to the lug (though Maace I will2
165 insist was reclined from overdoing this, his recovery often being3
165 slow) and then, O! on the third dead beat, O! to cluse her eyes4
165 and aiopen her oath and see what spice I may send her. How?5
165 Cease thee, cantatrickee! I fain would be solo. Arouse thee, my6
165 valour! And save for e'er my true Bdur!7
165        I shall have a word to say in a few yards about the acoustic 8
165 and orchidectural management of the tonehall but, as ours is a9
165 vivarious where one plant's breaf is a lunger planner's byscent10
165 and you may not care for argon, it will be very convenient for11
165 me for the emolument to pursue Burrus and Caseous for a rung12
165 or two up their isocelating biangle. Every admirer has seen my13
165 goulache of Marge (she is so like the sister, you don't know, and14
165 they both dress A L I K E !) which I titled The Very Picture of15
165 a Needlesswoman which in the presence ornates our national16
165 cruetstand. This genre of portraiture of changes of mind in order17
165 to be truly torse should evoke the bush soul of females so I am18
165 leaving it to the experienced victim to complete the general19
165 suggestion by the mental addition of a wallopy bound or, should20
165 the zulugical zealot prefer it, a congorool teal. The hatboxes21
165 which composed Rhomba, lady Trabezond (Marge in her ex-22
165 celsis), also comprised the climactogram up which B and C may23
165 fondly be imagined ascending and are suggestive of gentlemen's24
165 spring modes, these modes carrying us back to the superimposed25
165 claylayers of eocene and pleastoseen formation and the gradual26
165 morphological changes in our body politic which Professor27
165 Ebahi-Ahuri of Philadespoinis (Ill)         whose bluebutterbust I28
165 have just given his coupe de grass to         neatly names a boîte à29
165 surprises. The boxes, if I may break the subject gently, are worth30
165 about fourpence pourbox but I am inventing a more patent pro-31
165 cess, foolproof and pryperfect (I should like to ask that Shedlock32
165 Homes person who is out for removing the roofs of our criminal33
165 classics by what deductio ad domunum he hopes de tacto to detect34
165 anything unless he happens of himself, movibile tectu, to have a35
165 slade off) after which they can be reduced to a fragment of their36
166 true crust by even the youngest of Margees if she will take plase1
166 to be seated and smile if I please.2
166        Now there can be no question about it either that I having 3
166 done as much, have quite got the size of that demilitery young4
166 female (we will continue to call her Marge) whose types may be5
166 met with in any public garden, wearing a very "dressy" affair,6
166 known as an "ethel" of instep length and with a real fur, reduced7
166 to 3/9, and muffin cap to tone (they are "angelskin" this fall),8
166 ostentatiously hemming apologetically over the shirtness of9
166 some "sweet" garment, when she is not sitting on all the free10
166 benches avidously reading about "it" but ovidently on the look11
166 out for "him" or so "thrilled" about the best dressed dolly pram12
166 and beautiful elbow competition or at the movies swallowing13
166 sobs and blowing bixed mixcuits over "childe" chaplain's "latest"14
166 or on the verge of the gutter with some bobbedhair brieffrocked15
166 babyma's toddler (the Smythe-Smythes now keep TWO domes-16
166 tics and aspire to THREE male ones, a shover, a butlegger and17
166 a sectary) held hostage at armslength, teaching His Infant18
166 Majesty how to make waters worse.19
166        (I am closely watching Master Pules, as I have regions to sus- 20
166 pect from my post that her "little man" is a secondary school-21
166 teacher under the boards of education, a voted disciple of Infan-22
166 tulus who is being utilised thus publicly by the seducente infanta23
166 to conceal her own more mascular personality by flaunting24
166 frivolish finery over men's inside clothes, for the femininny of25
166 that totamulier will always lack the musculink of a verumvirum.26
166 My solotions for the proper parturience of matres and the edu-27
166 cation of micturious mites must stand over from the moment till28

166        Margareena she's very fond of Burrus but, alick and alack! 30
166 she velly fond of chee. (The important influence exercised on31
166 everything by this eastasian import has not been till now fully32
166 flavoured though we can comfortably taste it in this case. I shall33
166 come back for a little more say farther on.) A cleopatrician in34
166 her own right she at once complicates the position while Burrus35
166 and Caseous are contending for her misstery by implicating her-36
167 self with an elusive Antonius, a wop who would appear to hug1
167 a personal interest in refined chees of all chades at the same time2
167 as he wags an antomine art of being rude like the boor. This3
167 Antonius-Burrus-Caseous grouptriad may be said to equate4
167 the qualis equivalent with the older socalled talis on talis one5
167 just as quantly as in the hyperchemical economantarchy the tan-6
167 tum ergons irruminate the quantum urge so that eggs is to whey7

169 

a trio of barbels from his megageg chin (sowman's son), the

169 

wrong shoulder higher than the right, all ears, an artificial
15
169 

tongue with a natural curl, not a foot to stand on, a handful of

172 creditors, hearing a coarse song and splash off Eden Quay sighed15
172 and rolled over, sure all was up, but, though he fell heavily and16
172 locally into debit, not even then could such an antinomian be17
172 true to type. He would not put fire to his cerebrum; he would18
172 not throw himself in Liffey; he would not explaud himself with19
172 pneumantics; he refused to saffrocake himself with a sod. With20
172 the foreign devil's leave the fraid born fraud diddled even death.21

173 misused and cuttlefishing every lie unshrinkable about all the36
174 other people in the story, leaving out, of course, foreconsciously,1
174 the simple worf and plague and poison they had cornered him2
174 about until there was not a snoozer among them but was utterly3
174 undeceived in the heel of the reel by the recital of the rigmarole.4
174     He went without saying that the cull disliked anything anyway5
174 approaching a plain straightforward standup or knockdown row6
174 and, as often as he was called in to umpire any octagonal argu-7
174 ment among slangwhangers, the accomplished washout always8
174 used to rub shoulders with the last speaker and clasp shakers (the9
174 handtouch which is speech without words) and agree to every10
174 word as soon as half uttered, command me!, your servant, good,11

174 unbalanced attention upon the next octagonist who managed to17
174 catch a listener's eye, asking and imploring him out of his18
174 piteous onewinker, (hemoptysia diadumenos) whether there was19
174 anything in the world he could do to please him and to overflow20
174 his tumbletantaliser for him yet once more.21
174     One hailcannon night (for his departure was attended by a22
174 heavy downpour) as very recently as some thousand rains ago he23
174 was therefore treated with what closely resembled parsonal viol-24

174 and awake, reconciled (though they were as jealous as could be33
174 cullions about all the truffles they had brought on him) to a34
174 friendship, fast and furious, which merely arose out of the noxious35
174 pervert's perfect lowness. Again there was a hope that people,36
175 looking on him with the contemp of the contempibles, after1
175 first gaving him a roll in the dirt, might pity and forgive him, if2
175 properly deloused, but the pleb was born a Quicklow and sank3

189 the dynamitisation of colleagues, the reducing of records to35

190 of sweetempered gunpowdered didst unto dudst but it never1

190 new Irish stew.9
190       O, by the way, yes,another thing occurs to me. You let me tell 10
190 you, with the utmost politeness, were very ordinarily designed,11
190 your birthwrong was, to fall in with Plan, as our nationals12
190 should, as all nationists must, and do a certain office (what, I will13
190 not tell you) in a certain holy office (nor will I say where) during14
190 certain agonising office hours (a clerical party all to yourself) from15
190 such a year to such an hour on such and such a date at so and16
190 so much a week pro anno (Guinness's, may I remind, were just17
190 agulp for you, failing in which you might have taken the scales off18
190 boilers like any boskop of Yorek) and do your little thruppenny19
190 bit and thus earn from the nation true thanks, right here in our20
190 place of burden, your bourne of travail and ville of tares, where21
190 after a divine's prodigence you drew the first watergasp in your22
190 life, from the crib where you once was bit to the crypt you'll23
190 be twice as shy of, same as we, long of us, alone with the colt24
190 in the curner, where you were as popular as an armenial with25
190 the faithful, and you set fire to my tailcoat when I hold the26
190 paraffin smoker under yours (I hope that chimney's clear) but,27
190 slackly shirking both your bullet and your billet, you beat it28
190 backwards like Boulanger from Galway (but he combed the grass29
190 against his stride) to sing us a song of alibi, (the cuthone call over30

201       For the putty affair I have is wore out, so it is, sitting,yaping and 7
201 waiting for my old Dane hodder dodderer, my life in death companion,8
201 my frugal key of our larder, my much-altered camel's hump, my9

201 to wake himself out of his winter's doze and bore me down like he11

201       Onon! Onon! tell me more. Tell me every tiny teign. I want 21

201 hatchery part. After Clondalkin the Kings's Inns. We'll soon be26
201 there with the freshet. How many aleveens had she in tool? I can't27
201 rightly rede you that. Close only knows. Some say she had three28
201 figures to fill and confined herself to a hundred eleven, wan by-29
201 wan bywan, making meanacuminamoyas. Olaph lamm et, all that30
201 pack? We won't have room in the kirkeyaard. She can't remember31

201 boxing bishop's infallible slipper, the cane for Kund and abbles for33
201 Eyolf and ayther nayther for Yakov Yea. A hundred and how?34
201 They did well to rechristien her Pluhurabelle. O loreley! What a35

202 more and merrier, twills and trills, sparefours and spoilfives, nord-1

202 nap and Messamisery and the knave of all knaves and the joker.3
202 Heehaw! She must have been a gadabount in her day, so she4
202 must, more than most. Shoal she was, gidgad. She had a flewmen5

202 that's agapo! Tell me, tell me, how cam she camlin through all7
202 her fellows, the neckar she was, the diveline? Casting her
perils8
202 before our swains from Fonte-in-Monte to Tidingtown and9
202 from Tidingtown tilhavet. Linking one and knocking the next,10
202 tapting a flank and tipting a jutty and palling in and pietaring11
202 out and clyding by on her eastway. Waiwhou was the first thur-12
202 ever burst? Someone he was, whuebra they were, in a tactic attack13
202 or in single combat. Tinker, tilar, souldrer, salor, Pieman Peace14

202 he did or how blyth she played or how, when, why, where and25
202 who offon he jumpnad her and how it was gave her away. She26
202 was just a young thin pale soft shy slim slip of a thing then,27
202 sauntering, by silvamoonlake and he was a heavy trudging28
202 lurching lieabroad of a Curraghman, making his hay for whose29

202 used to rustle that time down by the dykes of killing Kildare,31
202 for forstfellfoss with a plash across her. She thought she's sankh32

202 tigris eye ! O happy fault ! Me wish it was he ! You're wrong there,34
202 corribly wrong! Tisn't only tonight you're anacheronistic! It35
202 was ages behind that when nullahs were nowhere, in county36
203 Wickenlow, garden of Erin, before she ever dreamt she'd lave1
203 Kilbride and go foaming under Horsepass bridge, with the great2
203 southerwestern windstorming her traces and the midland's grain-3
203 waster asarch for her track, to wend her ways byandby, robecca4
203 or worse, to spin and to grind, to swab and to thrash, for all her5
203 golden lifey in the barleyfields and pennylotts of Humphrey's6

203 Ovoca? Was it yst with wyst or Lucan Yokan or where the hand15

203 will if you listen. You know the dinkel dale of Luggelaw? Well,17
203 there once dwelt a local heremite, Michael Arklow was his river-18

203 looked, Nance the Nixie, Nanon L'Escaut, in the silence, of the sy-21
203 comores, all listening, the kindling curves you simply can't stop22
203 feeling, he plunged both of his newly anointed hands, the core of23
203 his cushlas, in her singimari saffron strumans of hair, parting them24
203 and soothing her and mingling it, that was deepdark and ample25
203 like this red bog at sundown. By that Vale Vowclose's lucydlac,26
203 the reignbeau's heavenarches arronged orranged her. Afroth-27
203 dizzying galbs, her enamelled eyes indergoading him on to the28
203 vierge violetian. Wish a wish! Why a why? Mavro ! Letty Lerck's29
203 lafing light throw those laurals now on her daphdaph teasesong30
203 petrock. Maass! But the majik wavus has elfun anon meshes.31
203 And Simba the Slayer of his Oga is slewd. He cuddle not help32
203 himself, thurso that hot on him, he had to forget the monk in33
203 the man so, rubbing her up and smoothing her down, he baised34
203 his lippes in smiling mood, kiss akiss after kisokushk (as he35
203 warned her niver to, niver to, nevar) on Anna-na-Poghue's of36
204 the freckled forehead. While you'd parse secheressa she hielt her1
204 souff'. But she ruz two feet hire in her aisne aestumation. And2
204 steppes on stilts ever since. That was kissuahealing with bantur3
204 for balm! O, wasn't he the bold priest? And wasn't she the4
204 naughty Livvy? Nautic Naama's now her navn. Two lads in5
204 scoutsch breeches went through her before that, Barefoot Burn6
204 and Wallowme Wade, Lugnaquillia's noblesse pickts, before she7
204 had a hint of a hair at her fanny to hide or a bossom to tempt a8
204 birch canoedler not to mention a bulgic porterhouse barge. And9
204 ere that again, leada, laida, all unraidy, too faint to buoy the10
204 fairiest rider, too frail to flirt with a cygnet's plume, she was licked11
204 by a hound, Chirripa-Chirruta, while poing her pee, pure and12
204 simple, on the spur of the hill in old Kippure, in birdsong and13
204 shearingtime, but first of all, worst of all, the wiggly livvly, she14
204 sideslipped out by a gap in the Devil's glen while Sally her nurse15
204 was sound asleep in a sloot and, feefee fiefie, fell over a spillway16
204 before she found her stride and lay and wriggled in all the stag-17
204 nant black pools of rainy under a fallow coo and she laughed18
204 innocefree with her limbs aloft and a whole drove of maiden19
204 hawthorns blushing and looking askance upon her.20
204       Drop me the sound of the findhorn's name, Mtu or Mti, som- 21
204 bogger was wisness. And drip me why in the flenders was she22
204 frickled. And trickle me through was she marcellewaved or was23
204 it weirdly a wig she wore. And whitside did they droop their24
204 glows in their florry, aback to wist or affront to sea? In fear to25
204 hear the dear so near or longing loth and loathing longing? Are26
204 you in the swim or are you out? O go in, go on, go an! I mean27
204 about what you know. I know right well what you mean. Rother!28
204 You'd like the coifs and guimpes, snouty, and me to do the29
204 greasy jub on old Veronica's wipers. What am I rancing now30
204 and I'll thank you? Is it a pinny or is it a surplice? Arran, where's31
204 your nose? And where's the starch? That's not the vesdre bene-32
204 diction smell. I can tell from here by their eau de Colo and the33
204 scent of her oder they're Mrs Magrath's. And you ought to have34
204 aird them. They've moist come off her. Creases in silk they35
204 are, not crampton lawn. Baptiste me, father, for she has sinned!36
205 Through her catchment ring she freed them easy, with her hips'1
205 hurrahs for her knees'dontelleries. The only parr with frills in2
205 old the plain. So they are, I declare! Welland well! If tomorrow3
205 keeps fine who'll come tripping to sightsee? How'll? Ask me4
205 next what I haven't got! The Belvedarean exhibitioners. In their5
205 cruisery caps and oarsclub colours. What hoo, they band! And6
205 what hoa, they buck! And here is her nubilee letters too. Ellis7
205 on quay in scarlet thread. Linked for the world on a flush-8
205 caloured field. Annan exe after to show they're not Laura

205 own's. O, may the diabolo twisk your seifety pin! You child of10
205 Mammon, Kinsella's Lilith! Now who has been tearing the leg11
205 of her drawars on her? Which leg is it? The one with the bells12
205 on it. Rinse them out and aston along with you! Where did I13
205 stop? Never stop! Continuarration! You're not there yet. I14

205       Well, after it was put in the Mericy Cordial Mendicants' Sitter- 16
205 dag-Zindeh-Munaday Wakeschrift (for once they sullied their17
205 white kidloves, chewing cuds after their dinners of cheeckin and18

205 Everywhere erriff you went and every bung you arver dropped23

205 scoured the countryside from Nannywater to Vartryville or from26
205 Porta Lateen to the lootin quarter you found his ikom etsched27
205 tipside down or the cornerboys cammocking his guy and Morris28
205 the Man, with the role of a royss in his turgos the turrible, (Evro-29

205 reeling and railing round the local as the peihos piped und uban-32
205 jees twanged, with oddfellow's triple tiara busby rotundarinking33
205 round his scalp. Like Pate-by-the-Neva or Pete-over-Meer. This34
205 is the Hausman all paven and stoned, that cribbed the Cabin that35
205 never was owned that cocked his leg and hennad his Egg. And36
206 the mauldrin rabble around him in areopage, fracassing a great1
206 bingkan cagnan with their timpan crowders. Mind your Grimm-2
206 father! Think of your Ma! Hing the Hong is his jove's hang-3
206 nomen ! Lilt a bolero, bulling a law ! She swore on croststyx nyne4
206 wyndabouts she's be level with all the snags of them yet. Par the5
206 Vulnerable Virgin's Mary del Dame! So she said to herself she'd6
206 frame a plan to fake a shine, the mischiefmaker, the like of it you7
206 niever heard. What plan? Tell me quick and dongu so crould!8
206 What the meurther did she mague? Well, she bergened a zakbag,9
206 a shammy mailsack, with the lend of a loan of the light of his10
206 lampion, off one of her swapsons, Shaun the Post, and then she11
206 went and consulted her chapboucqs, old Mot Moore, Casey's12
206 Euclid and the Fashion Display and made herself tidal to join13
206 in the mascarete. O gig goggle of gigguels. I can't tell you how!14
206 It's too screaming to rizo, rabbit it all! Minneha, minnehi mina-15
206 aehe, minneho! O but you must, you must really! Make my hear16
206 it gurgle gurgle, like the farest gargle gargle in the dusky dirgle17
206 dargle! By the holy well of Mulhuddart I swear I'd pledge my18
206 chanza getting to heaven through Tirry and Killy's mount of19
206 impiety to hear it all, aviary word! O, leave me my faculties,20
206 woman, a while! If you don't like my story get out of the punt.21
206 Well, have it your own way, so. Here, sit down and do as you're22
206 bid. Take my stroke and bend to your bow. Forward in and pull23
206 your overthepoise! Lisp it slaney and crisp it quiet. Deel me long-24
206 some. Tongue your time now. Breathe thet deep. Thouat's the25
206 fairway. Hurry slow and scheldt you go. Lynd us your blessed26
206 ashes here till I scrub the canon's underpants. Flow now. Ower27
206 more. And pooleypooley.28
206       First she let her hair fal and down it flussed to her feet its 29
206 teviots winding coils. Then, mothernaked, she sampood herself30
206 with galawater and fraguant pistania mud, wupper and lauar,31
206 from crown to sole. Next she greesed the groove of her keel,32
206 warthes and wears and mole and itcher, with antifouling butter-33
206 scatch and turfentide and serpenthyme and with leafmould she34
206 ushered round prunella isles and eslats dun, quincecunct, allover35
206 her little mary. Peeld gold of waxwork her jellybelly and her36
207 grains of incense anguille bronze. And after that she wove a gar-1
207 land for her hair. She pleated it. She plaited it. Of meadowgrass2
207 and riverflags, the bulrush and waterweed, and of fallen griefs of3
207 weeping willow. Then she made her bracelets and her anklets4
207 and her armlets and a jetty amulet for necklace of clicking cobbles5
207 and pattering pebbles and rumbledown rubble, richmond and6
207 rehr, of Irish rhunerhinerstones and shellmarble bangles. That7
207 done, a dawk of smut to her airy ey, Annushka Lutetiavitch8
207 Pufflovah, and the lellipos cream to her lippeleens and the pick9
207 of the paintbox for her pommettes, from strawbirry reds to10
207 extra violates, and she sendred her boudeloire maids to His11
207 Affluence, Ciliegia Grande and Kirschie Real, the two chirsines,12
207 with respecks from his missus, seepy and sewery, and a request13
207 might she passe of him for a minnikin. A call to pay and light a14
207 taper, in Brie-on-Arrosa, back in a sprizzling. The cock striking15
207 mine, the stalls bridely sign, there's Zambosy waiting for Me!16
207 She said she wouldn't be half her length away. Then, then, as17
207 soon as the lump his back was turned, with her mealiebag slang18
207 over her shulder, Anna Livia, oysterface, forth of her bassein19
207 came.20
207       Describe her! Hustle along, why can't you? Spitz on the iern 21
207 while it's hot. I wouldn't miss her for irthing on nerthe. Not for22
207 the lucre of lomba strait. Oceans of Gaud, I mosel hear that!23
207 Ogowe presta! Leste, before Julia sees her! Ishekarry and washe-24
207 meskad, the carishy caratimaney? Whole lady fair? Duodecimo-25
207 roon? Bon a ventura? Malagassy? What had she on, the liddel oud26
207 oddity? How much did she scallop, harness and weights? Here27
207 she is, Amnisty Ann! Call her calamity electrifies man.28
207       No electress at all but old Moppa Necessity, angin mother of 29
207 injons. I'll tell you a test. But you must sit still. Will you hold30
207 your peace and listen well to what I am going to say now? It31
207 might have been ten or twenty to one of the night of Allclose or32
207 the nexth of April when the flip of her hoogly igloo flappered and33
207 out toetippit a bushman woman, the dearest little moma ever34
207 you saw, nodding around her, all smiles, with ems of embarras35
207 and aues to awe, between two ages, a judyqueen, not up to your36
208 elb. Quick, look at her cute and saise her quirk for the bicker she1
208 lives the slicker she grows. Save us and tagus ! No more? Werra2
208 where in ourthe did you ever pick a Lambay chop as big as a3
208 battering ram? Ay, you're right. I'm epte to forgetting, Like4
208 Liviam Liddle did Loveme Long. The linth of my hough, I say !5
208 She wore a ploughboy's nailstudded clogs, a pair of ploughfields6
208 in themselves: a sugarloaf hat with a gaudyquiviry peak and a7
208 band of gorse for an arnoment and a hundred streamers dancing8
208 off it and a guildered pin to pierce it: owlglassy bicycles boggled9
208 her eyes: and a fishnetzeveil for the sun not to spoil the wrinklings10
208 of her hydeaspects: potatorings boucled the loose laubes of her11
208 laudsnarers: her nude cuba stockings were salmospotspeckled: she12
208 sported a galligo shimmy of hazevaipar tinto that never was fast13

208 natural nigger boggers, fancyfastened, free to undo: her black-16
208 stripe tan joseph was sequansewn and teddybearlined, with wavy17
208 rushgreen epaulettes and a leadown here and there of royal18
208 swansruff: a brace of gaspers stuck in her hayrope garters: her19
208 civvy codroy coat with alpheubett buttons was boundaried round20
208 with a twobar tunnel belt: a fourpenny bit in each pocketside21
208 weighed her safe from the blowaway windrush; she had a clothes-22

208 fluve of the tail of the gawan of her snuffdrab siouler's skirt25
208 trailed ffiffty odd Irish miles behind her lungarhodes.26
208       Hellsbells, I'm sorry I missed her! Sweet gumptyum and no- 27
208 body fainted ! But in whelk of her mouths? Was her naze alight?28
208 Everyone that saw her said the dowce little delia looked a bit29
208 queer. Lotsy trotsy, mind the poddle! Missus, be good and don't30
208 fol in the say! Fenny poor hex she must have charred. Kickhams31
208 a frumpier ever you saw! Making mush mullet's eyes at her boys32
208 dobelon. And they crowned her their chariton queen, all the33
208 maids. Of the may? You don't say! Well for her she couldn't34
208 see herself. I recknitz wharfore the darling murrayed her mirror.35
208 She did? Mersey me! There was a koros of drouthdropping sur-36

209 of her filimentation, lolling and leasing on North Lazers' Waal3
209 all eelfare week by the Jukar Yoick's and as soon as they saw her4
209 meander by that marritime way in her grasswinter's weeds and5

209       But what was the game in her mixed baggyrhatty? Just the 10
209 tembo in her tumbo or pilipili from her pepperpot? Saas and11
209 taas and specis bizaas. And where in thunder did she plunder?12
209 Fore the battle or efter the ball? I want to get it frisk from the13

209 spittle, with a Christmas box apiece for aisch and iveryone of her27
209 childer, the birthday gifts they dreamt they gabe her, the spoiled28
209 she fleetly laid at our door! On the matt, by the pourch and in-29

209 pollynooties. Out of the paunschaup on to the pyre. And they all31
209 about her, juvenile leads and ingenuinas, from the slime of their32

225       The flossies all and mossies all they drooped upon her draped 35

226 The pearlagraph, the pearlagraph, knew whitchly whether to weep1
226 or laugh. For always down in Carolinas lovely Dinahs vaunt their2

226 Hey, lass! Woefear gleam she so glooming, this pooripathete I6

226 where she's going to too. Buf if he'll go to be a son to France's9
226 she'll stay daughter of Clare. Bring tansy, throw myrtle, strew10
226 rue, rue, rue. She is fading out like Journee's clothes so you can't11
226 see her now. Still we know how Day the Dyer works, in dims12
226 and deeps and dusks and darks. And among the shades that Eve's13
226 now wearing she'll meet anew fiancy, tryst and trow. Mammy14
226 was, Mimmy is, Minuscoline's to be. In the Dee dips a dame and15
226 the dame desires a demselle but the demselle dresses dolly and16
226 the dolly does a dulcydamble. The same renew. For though17
226 she's unmerried she'll after truss up and help that hussyband how18

226 garland.23
226       Catchmire stockings, libertyed garters, shoddyshoes, quicked 24
226 out with selver. Pennyfair caps on pinnyfore frocks and a ring on25
226 her fomefing finger. And they leap so looply, looply, as they link26
226 to light. And they look so loovely, loovelit, noosed in a nuptious27
226 night. Withasly glints in. Andecoy glants out. They ramp it a28
226 little, a lessle, a lissle. Then rompride round in rout.29

248 you, my bottom's a vulser if ever there valsed and my whole the12

248 hang the halunkenend. For I see through your weapon. That15
248 cry's not Cucullus. And his eyelids are painted. If my tutor here16
248 is cut out for an oldeborre I'm Flo, shy of peeps, you know. But17
248 when he beetles backwards, ain't I fly? Pull the boughpee to see18

248 'Twas my lord of Glendalough benedixed the gape for me that30

249       In the house of breathings lies that word, all fairness. The walls 6
249 are of rubinen and the glittergates of elfinbone. The roof herof is7
249 of massicious jasper and a canopy of Tyrian awning rises and8
249 still descends to it. A grape cluster of lights hangs therebeneath9
249 and all the house is filled with the breathings of her fairness, the10
249 fairness of fondance and the fairness of milk and rhubarb and the11
249 fairness of roasted meats and uniomargrits and the fairness of12
249 promise with consonantia and avowals. There lies her word, you13
249 reder! The height herup exalts it and the lowness her down aba-14
249 seth it. It vibroverberates upon the tegmen and prosplodes from15
249 pomoeria. A window, a hedge, a prong, a hand, an eye, a sign, a16
249 head and keep your other augur on her paypaypay. And you have17
249 it, old Sem, pat as ah be seated! And Sunny, my gander, he's18

380 self all alone by himself in his grand old handwedown pile after35
380 all of them had all gone off with themselves to their castles of36

383 
    Sure he hasn't got much of a bark 
3
383 
    And sure any he has it's all beside the mark. 
4
383 
    But O, Wreneagle Almighty, wouldn't un be a sky of
a lark 
5
383 
    To see that old buzzard whooping about for uns shirt

    Hohohoho, moulty Mark! 
9
383 
    You're the rummest old rooster ever flopped out of
a Noah's ark 
10
383 
    And you think you're cock of the wark. 
11

    Fowls, up! Tristy's the spry young spark

The winging ones. Seahawk, seagull, curlew and plover, kestrel

and capercallzie. All the birds of the sea they trolled out rightbold

Downbellow Kaempersally, listening in, as hard as they could, in
23
383 
Dubbeldorp, the donker, by the tourneyold of the wattarfalls,
24
383 
with their vuoxens and they kemin in so hattajocky (only a

384 bing, and listening. Moykle ahoykling!5
384       They were the big four, the four maaster waves of Erin, all 6
384 listening, four. There was old Matt Gregory and then besides old7
384 Matt there was old Marcus Lyons, the four waves, and oftentimes8
384 they used to be saying grace together, right enough, bausnabeatha,9
384 in Miracle Squeer: here now we are the four of us: old Matt Gre-10
384 gory and old Marcus and old Luke Tarpey: the four of us and11
384 sure, thank God, there are no more of us: and, sure now, you12
384 wouldn't go and forget and leave out the other fellow and old13
384 Johnny MacDougall: the four of us and no more of us and so14
384 now pass the fish for Christ sake, Amen: the way they used to be15
384 saying their grace before fish, repeating itself, after the interims16
384 of Augusburgh for auld lang syne. And so there they were, with17
384 their palms in their hands, like the pulchrum's proculs, spraining18
384 their ears, luistening and listening to the oceans of kissening, with19
384 their eyes glistening, all the four, when he was kiddling and20
384 cuddling and bunnyhugging scrumptious his colleen bawn and21
384 dinkum belle, an oscar sister, on the fifteen inch loveseat, behind22

384 vicemversem her ragbags et assaucyetiams, fore and aft, on and27
384 offsides, the brueburnt sexfutter, handson and huntsem, that was28
384 palpably wrong and bulbubly improper, and cuddling her and29
384 kissing her, tootyfay charmaunt, in her ensemble of maidenna30
384 blue, with an overdress of net, tickled with goldies, Isolamisola,31
384 and whisping and lisping her about Trisolanisans, how one was32
384 whips for one was two and two was lips for one was three, and33
384 dissimulating themself, with his poghue like Arrah-na-poghue,34
384 the dear dear annual, they all four remembored who made the35
384 world and how they used to be at that time in the vulgar ear36
385 cuddling and kiddling her, after an oyster supper in Cullen's bam,1
385 from under her mistlethrush and kissing and listening, in the good2
385 old bygone days of Dion Boucicault, the elder, in Arrah-na-3

385 tongue Common, with Nush, the carrier of the word, and with5
385 Mesh, the cutter of the reed, in one of the farback, pitchblack6
385 centuries when who made the world, when they knew O'Clery,7

385 was shining, with their slates and satchels, playing Florian's fables11
385 and communic suctions and vellicar frictions with mixum mem-12

385 a prime number, Totius Quotius, and paying a pot of tribluts14
385 to Boris O'Brien, the buttler of Clumpthump, two looves, two15
385 turnovers plus (one) crown, to see the mad dane ating his16
385 vitals. Wulf! Wulf! And throwing his tongue in the snakepit. Ah17
385 ho! The ladies have mercias! It brought the dear prehistoric18
385 scenes all back again, as fresh as of yore, Matt and Marcus, natu-19
385 ral born lovers of nature, in all her moves and senses, and after20
385 that now there he was, that mouth of mandibles, vowed to pure21
385 beauty, and his Arrah-na-poghue, when she murmurously, after22
385 she let a cough, gave her firm order, if he wouldn't please mind,23
385 for a sings to one hope a dozen of the best favourite lyrical24
385 national blooms in Luvillicit, though not too much, reflecting on25
385 the situation, drinking in draughts of purest air serene and re-26
385 velling in the great outdoors, before the four of them, in the fair27
385 fine night, whilst the stars shine bright, by she light of he moon,28
385 we longed to be spoon, before her honeyoldloom, the plaint effect29
385 being in point of fact there being in the whole, a seatuition so30
385 shocking and scandalous and now, thank God, there were no more31
385 of them and he poghuing and poghuing like the Moreigner32
385 bowed his crusted hoed and Tilly the Tailor's Tugged a Tar in the33
385 Arctic Newses Dagsdogs number and there they were, like a34
385 foremasters in the rolls, listening, to Rolando's deepen darblun35
385 Ossian roll, (Lady, it was just too gorgeous, that expense of a36
386 lovely tint, embellished by the charms of art and very well con-1
386 ducted and nicely mannered and all the horrid rudy noisies locked2
386 up in nasty cubbyhole!) as tired as they were, the three jolly3
386 topers, with their mouths watering, all the four, the old connu-4

386 the millennium and all their mouths making water.11
386       Johnny. Ah well, sure, that's the way (up) and it so happened 12
386 there was poor Matt Gregory (up), their pater familias, and (up)13
386 the others and now really and (up) truly they were four dear14
386 old heladies and really they looked awfully pretty and so nice and15
386 bespectable and after that they had their fathomglasses to find16
386 out all the fathoms and their half a tall hat, just now like the old17
386 Merquus of Pawerschoof, the old determined despot, (quiescents18
386 in brage!) only for the extrusion of the saltwater or the auctioneer19

387 say) all over like a tiara dullfuoco, in his grey half a tall hat and3

387 out all the improper colleges (and how do you do, Mr Dame7

387 bellied and boneless, from Strathlyffe and Aylesburg and North-9

387 wolkingology and how our seaborn isle came into exestuance,12
387 (the explutor, his three andesiters and the two pantellarias) that13
387 reminds me about the manausteriums of the poor Marcus of Lyons14
387 and poor Johnny, the patrician, and what do you think of the four15
387 of us and there they were now, listening right enough, the four16
387 saltwater widowers, and all they could remembore, long long ago17
387 in the olden times Momonian, throw darker hour sorrows, the18
387 princest day, when Fair Margrate waited Swede Villem, and Lally19
387 in the rain, with the blank prints, now extincts, after the wreak20
387 of Wormans' Noe, the barmaisigheds, when my heart knew no21
387 care, and after that then there was the official landing of Lady22
387 Jales Casemate, in the year of the flood 1132 S.O.S., and the23
387 christening of Queen Baltersby, the Fourth Buzzersbee, accord-24
387 ing to Her Grace the bishop Senior, off the whate shape, and25
387 then there was the drowning of Pharoah and all his pedestrians26
387 and they were all completely drowned into the sea, the red sea,27
387 and then poor Merkin Cornyngwham, the official out of the28
387 castle on pension, when he was completely drowned off Erin29
387 Isles, at that time, suir knows, in the red sea and a lovely30
387 mourning paper and thank God, as Saman said, there were no31
387 more of him. And that now was how it was. The arzurian deeps32

388 a lovely morning, after the universal flood, at about aleven thirty-12
388 two was it? off the coast of Cominghome and Saint Patrick, the13

421 Notorious I rather would feel inclined to myself in the first place24
421 to describe Mr O'Shem the Draper with before letter as should25
421 I be accentually called upon for a dieoguinnsis to pass my opinions,26
421 properly spewing, into impulsory irelitz. But I would not care to27
421 be so unfruitful to my own part as to swear for the moment posi-28
421 tively as to the views of Denmark. No, sah! But let me say my29
421 every belief before my high Gee is that I much doubt of it. I've no30
421 room for that fellow on my fagroaster, I just can't. As I hourly31
421 learn from Rooters and Havers through Gilligan's maypoles in32
421 a nice pathetic notice he, the pixillated doodler, is on his last with33
421 illegible clergimanths boasting always of his ruddy complexious!34
421 She, the mammy far, was put up to it by him, the iniquity that35
421 ought to be depraved of his libertins to be silenced, sackclothed36
422 and suspended, and placed in irons into some drapyery institution1
422 off the antipopees for wordsharping only if he was klanver enough2
422 to pass the panel fleischcurers and the fieldpost censor. Gach!3
422 For that is a fullblown fact and well celibated before the four4
422 divorce courts and all the King's paunches, how he has the5
422 solitary from seeing Scotch snakes and has a lowsense for the pro-6
422 duction of consumption and dalickey cyphalos on his brach7
422 premises where he can purge his contempt and dejeunerate into a8

422               May we petition you, Shaun illustrious, then, to put his 19
422 prentis' pride in your aproper's purse and to unravel in your own20
422 sweet way with words of style to your very and most obse-21

422               Well it is partly my own, isn't it? and you may, ought and 23
422 welcome, Shaun replied, taking at the same time, as his hunger24
422 got the bitter of him, a hearty bite out of the honeycomb of his25
422 Braham and Melosedible hat, tryone, tryon and triune. Ann wun-26

423 there shall be no more Kates and Nells. If you see him it took12
423 place there. It was given meeck, thank the Bench, to assist at the13
423 whole thing byck special chancery licence. As often as I think of14
423 that unbloody housewarmer, Shem Skrivenitch, always cutting15
423 my prhose to please his phrase, bogorror, I declare I get the16
423 jawache! Be me punting his reflection he'd begin his beogre-17
423 fright in muddyass ribalds. Digteter! Grundtsagar! Swop beef!18
423 You know he's peculiar, that eggschicker, with the smell of old19
423 woman off him, to suck nothing of his switchedupes. M.D. made20
423 his ante mortem for him. He was grey at three, like sygnus the21
423 swan, when he made his boo to the public and barnacled up to the22
423 eyes when he repented after seven. The alum that winters on his23
423 top is the stale of the staun that will soar when he stambles till24
423 that hag of the coombe rapes the pad off his lock. He was down25
423 with the whooping laugh at the age of the loss of reason the26
423 whopping first time he prediseased me. He's weird, I tell you, and27
423 middayevil down to his vegetable soul. Never mind his falls28
423 feet and his tanbark complexion. That's why he was forbidden29
423 tomate and was warmed off the ricecourse of marrimoney, under30
423 the Helpless Corpses Enactment. I'm not at all surprised the saint31
423 kicked him whereby the sum taken Berkeley showed the reason32
423 genrously. Negas, negasti       negertop, negertoe, negertoby, ne-33
423 grunter! Then he was pusched out of Thingamuddy's school34
423 by Miss Garterd, for itching. Then he caught the europicolas and35
423 went into the society of jewses. With Bro Cahlls and Fran Czeschs36
424 and Bruda Pszths and Brat Slavos. One temp when he foiled to1
424 be killed, the freak wanted to put his bilingual head intentionally2
424 through the Ikish Tames and go and join the clericy as a demoni-3
424 can skyterrier. Throwing dust in the eyes of the Hooley Fer-4
424 mers! He used to be avowdeed as he ought to be vitandist. For5
424 onced I squeaked by twyst I'll squelch him. Then he went to6
424 Cecilia's treat on his solo to pick up Galen. Asbestopoulos! Inku-7
424 pot! He has encaust in the blood. Shim! I have the outmost con-8
424 tempt for. Prost bitten! Conshy! Tiberia is waiting on you,9
424 arestocrank! Chaka a seagull ticket at Gattabuia and Gabbiano's!10
424 Go o'er the sea, haythen, from me and leave your libber to TCD.11

424               But for what, thrice truthful teller, Shaun of grace? weakly 14
424 we went on to ask now of the gracious one. Vouchsafe to say.15
424 You will now, goodness, won't you? Why?16
424               For his root language, if you ask me whys, Shaun replied, 17
424 as he blessed himself devotionally like a crawsbomb, making act18
424 of oblivion, footinmouther! (what the thickuns else?) which he19
424 picksticked into his lettruce invrention. Ullhodturdenweirmud-20

424 O', we foresupposed. How?25
424               Peax! Peax! Shaun replied in vealar penultimatum. 'Tis 26
424 pebils before Sweeney's as he swigged a slug of Jon Jacobsen27
424 from his treestem sucker cane. Mildbut likesome! I might as28
424 well be talking to the four waves till tibbes grey eves and the29
424 rests asleep. Frost! Nope! No one in his seven senses could as30
424 I have before said, only you missed my drift, for it's being in-31
424 cendiary. Every dimmed letter in it is a copy and not a few of the32
424 silbils and wholly words I can show you in my Kingdom of33
424 Heaven. The lowquacity of him! With his threestar monothong!34
424 Thaw! The last word in stolentelling! And what's more right-35
424 down lowbrown schisthematic robblemint! Yes. As he was rising36
425 my lather. Like you. And as I was plucking his goosybone. Like1
425 yea. He store the tale of me shur. Like yup. How's that for2
425 Shemese?3
425               Still in a way, not to flatter you, we fancy you that you are 4
425 so strikingly brainy and well letterread in yourshelves as ever were5
425 the Shamous Shamonous, Limited, could use worse of yourself, in-6
425 genious Shaun, we still so fancied, if only you would take your7
425 time so and the trouble of so doing it. Upu now!8
425               Undoubtedly but that is show, Shaun replied, the mutter- 9
425 melk of his blood donor beginning to work, and while innocent10
425 of disseminating the foul emanation, it would be a fall day I11
425 could not, sole, so you can keep your space and by the power of12
425 blurry wards I am loyable to do it (I am convicted of it!) any time13
425 ever I liked (bet ye fippence off me boot allowance!) with the14
425 allergrossest transfusiasm as, you see, while I can soroquise the15
425 Siamanish better than most, it is an openear secret, be it said,16
425 how I am extremely ingenuous at the clerking even with my17
425 badily left and, arrah go braz, I'd pinsel it with immenuensoes18
425 as easy as I'd perorate a chickerow of beans for the price of two19
425 maricles and my trifolium librotto, the authordux Book of Lief,20
425 would, if given to daylight, (I hold a most incredible faith about21
425 it) far exceed what that bogus bolshy of a shame, my soamheis22
425 brother, Gaoy Fecks, is conversant with in audible black and23
425 prink. Outragedy of poetscalds! Acomedy of letters! I have24
425 them all, tame, deep and harried, in my mine's I. And one of25
425 these fine days, man dear, when the mood is on me, that I26
425 may willhap cut my throat with my tongue tonight but I will27
425 be ormuzd moved to take potlood and introvent it Paatryk just28

425 brooher, only for, as a papst and an immature and a nayophight31
425 and a spaciaman spaciosum and a hundred and eleven other things,32
425 I would never for anything take so much trouble of such doing.33
425 And why so? Because I am altogether a chap too fly and hairyman34
425 for to infradig the like of that ultravirulence. And by all I hold35
425 sacred on earth clouds and in heaven I swear to you on my piop36
426 and oath by the awe of Shaun (and that's a howl of a name!) that1
426 I will commission to the flames any incendiarist whosoever or2

427 really uprighted ere in a dip of the downs (uila!) he spoorlessly6

429       Jaunty Jaun, as I was shortly before that made aware, next 1
429 halted to fetch a breath,the first cothurminous leg of his night-2
429 stride being pulled through, and to loosen (let God's son now be3
429 looking down on the poor preambler!) both of his bruised4
429 brogues that were plainly made a good bit before his hosen were,5
429 at the weir by Lazar's Walk (for far and wide, as large as he was6
429 lively, was he noted for his humane treatment of any kind of7
429 abused footgear), a matter of maybe nine score or so barrelhours8
429 distance off as truly he merited to do. He was there, you could9
429 planemetrically see, when I took a closer look at him, that was to10
429 say, (gracious helpings, at this rate of growing our cotted child of11
429 yestereve will soon fill space and burst in systems, so speeds the12
429 instant!) amply altered for the brighter, though still the graven13
429 image of his squarer self as he was used to be, perspiring but14
429 happy notwithstanding his foot was still asleep on him, the way15
429 he thought, by the holy januarious, he had a bullock's hoof in his16
429 buskin, with his halluxes so splendid, through Ireland untran-17
429 scended, bigmouthed poesther, propped up, restant, against a18
429 butterblond warden of the peace, one comestabulish Sigurdsen,19
429 (and where a better than such exsearfaceman to rest from roving20
429 the laddyown he bootblacked?) who, buried upright like the21
429 Osbornes, kozydozy, had tumbled slumbersomely on sleep at22
429 night duty behind the curing station, equilebriated amid the23
429 embracings of a monopolized bottle.24
430       Now, there were as many as twentynine hedge daughters out 1
430 of Benent Saint Berched's national nightschool (for they seemed2
430 to remember how it was still a once-upon-a-four year) learning3
430 their antemeridian lesson of life, under its tree, against its warn-4
430 ing, beseated, as they were, upon the brinkspondy, attracted to5
430 the rarerust sight of the first human yellowstone landmark (the6
430 bear, the boer, the king of all boors, sir Humphrey his knave7
430 we met on the moors!) while they paddled away, keeping time8
430 magnetically with their eight and fifty pedalettes, playing foolu-9
430 fool jouay allo misto posto, O so jaonickally, all barely in their10
430 typtap teens, describing a charming dactylogram of nocturnes11
430 though repelled by the snores of the log who looked stuck to12
430 the sod as ever and oft, when liquefied, (vil!) he murmoaned13
430 abasourdly in his Dutchener's native, visibly unmoved, over his14
430 treasure trove for the crown: Dotter dead bedstead mean diggy15
430 smuggy flasky!16
430       Jaun (after he had in the first place doffed a hat with a rein- 17
430 forced crown and bowed to all the others in that chorus of praise18
430 of goodwill girls on their best beehiviour who all they were girls19
430 all rushing sowarmly for the post as buzzy as sie could bie to read20

430 posy smile, mussing his frizzy hair and the golliwog curls of him,23
430 all, but that one; Finfria's fairest, done in loveletters like a trayful24
430 of cloudberry tartlets (ain't they fine, mighty, mighty fine and25
430 honoured?) and smilingly smelling, pair and pair about, broad26
430 by bread and slender to slimmer, the nice perfumios that came27
430 cunvy peeling off him (nice!) which was angelic simply, savouring28
430 of wild thyme and parsley jumbled with breadcrumbs (O nice!)29
430 and feeling his full fat pouch for him so tactily and jingaling30
430 his jellybags for, though he looked a young chapplie of sixtine,31
430 they could frole by his manhood that he was just the killingest32
430 ladykiller all by kindness, now you, Jaun, asking kindlily (hillo,33
430 missies!) after their howareyous at all with those of their dolly-34
430 begs (and where's Agatha's lamb? and how are Bernadetta's35
430 columbillas? and Juliennaw's tubberbunnies? and Eulalina's36
431 tuggerfunnies?) he next went on (finefeelingfit!) to drop a few1
431 stray remarks anent their personal appearances and the contrary2
431 tastes displayed in their tight kittycasques and their smart fricky-3
431 frockies, asking coy one after sloy one had she read Irish legginds4
431 and gently reproving one that the ham of her hom could be5
431 seen below her hem and whispering another aside, as lavariant,6
431 that the hook of her hum was open a bittock at her back to have7
431 a sideeye to that, hom, (and all of course just to fill up a form8
431 out of pure human kindness and in a sprite of fun) for Jaun, by9
431 the way, was by the way of becoming (I think, I hope he was)10
431 the most purely human being that ever was called man, loving all11
431 up and down the whole creation from Sampson's tyke to Jones's12
431 sprat and from the King of all Wrenns down to infuseries) Jaun,13
431 after those few prelimbs made out through his eroscope the14
431 apparition of his fond sister Izzy for he knowed his love by her15
431 waves of splabashing and she showed him proof by her way of16
431 blabushing nor could he forget her so tarnelly easy as all that17
431 since he was brotherbesides her benedict godfather and heaven18
431 knows he thought the world and his life of her sweet heart could19
431 buy, (brao!) poor, good, true, Jaun!20
431               Sister dearest, Jaun delivered himself with express cordia- 21
431 lity, marked by clearance of diction and general delivery, as he22
431 began to take leave of his scolastica at once so as to gain time23
431 with deep affection, we honestly believe you sorely will miss us24
431 the moment we exit yet we feel as a martyr to the dischurch of25
431 all duty that it is about time, by Great Harry, we would shove26
431 off to stray on our long last journey and not be the load on ye.27
431 This is the gross proceeds of your teachings in which we were28
431 raised, you, sis, that used to write to us the exceeding nice letters29
431 for presentation and would be telling us anun (full well do we30
431 wont to recall to mind) thy oldworld tales of homespinning and31
431 derringdo and dieobscure and daddyho, these tales which reliter-32

431 fairly tossing ourselves (O Phoebus! O Pollux!) in bed, having36

436 other respectable relative of an apposite sex, not love that leads17

436 no horning but if you've got some brainy notion to raise cancan35
436 and rouse commotion I'll be apt to flail that tail for you till it's36
437 borning. Let the love ladleliked at the eye girde your gastricks1
437 in the gym. Nor must you omit to screw the lid firmly on that2
437 jazz jiggery and kick starts. Bumping races on the flat and point3
437 to point over obstacles. Ridewheeling that acclivisciously up4
437 windy Rutland Rise and insighting rebellious northers before the5
437 saunter of the city of Dunlob. Then breretonbiking on the free6
437 with your airs of go-be-dee and your heels upon the handlebars.7
437 Berrboel brazenness! No, before your corselage rib is decartilaged,8
437 that is to mean if you have visceral ptossis, my point is, making9
437 allowances for the fads of your weak abdominal wall and your10
437 liver asprewl, vinvin, vinvin, or should you feel, in shorts, as11

437 It's more important than air         I mean than eats         air (Oop, I19

437 natural emotion. Stamp out bad eggs. Why so many puddings21
437 prove disappointing, as Dietician says, in Creature Comforts22
437 Causeries, and why so much soup is so muck slop. If we23
437 could fatten on the elizabeetons we wouldn't have teeth like24

437 envelope shirt I'd keep my weathereye well cocked open for26
437 your furnished lodgers paying for their feed on tally with27

450 And bemolly and jiesis! For I sport a whatyoumacormack in the25

450 is as cockful of funantics as it's tune to my fork. Naturale you27
450 might lower register me as diserecordant, but I'm athlone in the28

450 What's good for the gorse is a goad for the garden. Lethals lurk30
450 heimlocked in logans. Loathe laburnums. Dash the gaudy death-31
450 cup! Bryony O'Bryony, thy name is Belladama! But enough of32
450 greenwood's gossip. Birdsnests is birdsnests. Thine to wait but33
450 mine to wage. And now play sharp to me. Doublefirst I'll head34

450 I'd be possessed of at Latouche's, begor, I'd sink it sumtotal, every36

451 and I bait you my chancey oldcoat against the whole ounce you2
451 half on your backboard (if madamaud strips mesdamines may3
451 cold strafe illglands!) that I'm the gogetter that'd make it pay like4
451 cash registers as sure as there's a pot on a pole. And, what with one5
451 man's fish and a dozen men's poissons, sowing my wild plums to6
451 reap ripe plentihorns mead, lashings of erbole and hydromel and7
451 bragget, I'd come out with my magic fluke in close time, fair,8
451 free and frolicky, zooming tophole on the mart as a factor. And9
451 I tell you the Bective's wouldn't hold me. By the unsleeping10
451 Solman Annadromus, ye god of little pescies, nothing would11
451 stop me for mony makes multimony like the brogues and the12
451 kishes. Not the Ulster Rifles and the Cork Milice and the Dublin13
451 Fusees and Connacht Rangers ensembled! I'd axe the channon14
451 and leip a liffey and drink annyblack water that rann onme way.15
451 Yip! How's thats for scats, mine shatz, for a lovebird? To funk is16
451 only peternatural its daring feers divine. Bebold! Like Varian's17
451 balaying all behind me. And before you knew where you18
451 weren't, I stake my ignitial's divy, cash-and-cash-can-again, I'd19
451 be staggering humanity and loyally rolling you over, my sow-20
451 white sponse, in my tons of red clover, nighty nigh to the metro-21
451 nome, fiehigh and fiehigher and fiehighest of all. Holy petter and22

451 to do brut frull up fizz and unpop a few shortusians or shake a24
451 pale of sparkling ice, hear it swirl, happy girl! Not a spot of my25
451 hide but you'd love to seek and scanagain! There'd be no stand-26
451 ing me, I tell you. And, as gameboy as my pagan name K.C. is27
451 what it is, I'd never say let fly till we shot that blissup and28
451 swumped each other, manawife, into our sever nevers where I'd29
451 plant you, my Gizzygay, on the electric ottoman in the lap of30
451 lechery, simpringly stitchless with admiracion, among the most31
451 uxuriously furnished compartments, with sybarate chambers,just32
451 as I'd run my shoestring into near a million or so of them as a33

452 upon my tripos, and just thinking like thauthor how long I'd like10
452 myself to be continued at Hothelizod, peeking into the focus and11

452 tramsported with grief I am this night sublime, as you may see14
452 by my size and my brow that's all forehead, to go forth, frank15

452 grand thing (superb!) to be going to meet a king, not an every-26
452 night king, nenni, by gannies, but the overking of Hither-on-27
452 Thither Erin himself, pardee, I'm saying. Before there was patch28
452 at all on Ireland there lived a lord at Lucan. We only wish29

465 To be had for the asking. Have a hug! Take her out of poor22

467 I used to lend him before we split and, be the hole in the year,2

470 as, with a cry of genuine distress, so prettly prattly pollylogue,9
470 they viewed him, the just one, their darling, away.10

474        Lowly, longly, a wail went forth. Pure Yawn lay low. On the 1
474 mead of the hillock lay, heartsoul dormant mid shadowed land-2
474 shape, brief wallet to his side, and arm loose, by his staff of citron3
474 briar, tradition stick-pass-on. His dream monologue was over,4
474 of cause, but his drama parapolylogic had yet to be, affact. Most5
474 distressfully (but, my dear, how successfully!) to wail he did,6
474 his locks of a lucan tinge, quickrich, ripely rippling, unfilleted,7
474 those lashbetasselled lids on the verge of closing time, whiles8
474 ouze of his sidewiseopen mouth the breath of him, evenso9
474 languishing as the princeliest treble treacle or lichee chewchow10
474 purse could buy. Yawn in a semiswoon lay awailing and (hooh!)11
474 what helpings of honeyful swoothead (phew!), which ear-12
474 piercing dulcitude! As were you suppose to go and push with13
474 your bluntblank pin in hand upinto his fleshasplush cushionettes14
474 of some chubby boybold love of an angel. Hwoah!15
474        When, as the buzzer brings the light brigade, keeping the 16
474 home fires burning, so on the churring call themselves came at17
474 him, from the westborders of the eastmidlands, three kings of18
474 three suits and a crowner, from all their cardinal parts, along19
474 the amber way where Brosna's furzy. To lift them they did,20
474 senators four, by the first quaint skreek of the gloaming and21
474 they hopped it up the mountainy molehill, traversing climes22
474 of old times gone by of the days not worth remembering;23
474 inventing some excusethems, any sort, having a sevenply24
475 sweat of night blues moist upon them. Feefee! phopho!!1
475 foorchtha!!! aggala!!!! jeeshee!!!!! paloola!!!!!! ooridiminy!!!!!!!2
475 Afeared themselves were to wonder at the class of a crossroads3
475 puzzler he would likely be, length by breadth nonplussing his4
475 thickness, ells upon ells of him, making so many square yards of5
475 him, one half of him in Conn's half but the whole of him never-6
475 theless in Owenmore's five quarters. There would he lay till7
475 they would him descry, spancelled down upon a blossomy bed, at8
475 one foule stretch, amongst the daffydowndillies, the flowers of9
475 narcosis fourfettering his footlights, a halohedge of wild spuds10
475 hovering over him, epicures waltzing with gardenfillers, puritan11
475 shoots advancing to Aran chiefs. Phopho!! The meteor pulp12
475 of him, the seamless rainbowpeel. Aggala!!!! His bellyvoid of13
475 nebulose with his neverstop navel. Paloola!!!!!! And his veins14
475 shooting melanite phosphor, his creamtocustard cometshair and15
475 his asteroid knuckles, ribs and members. Ooridiminy!!!!!!!  His16
475 electrolatiginous twisted entrails belt.17
475        Those four claymen clomb together to hold their sworn star- 18
475 chamber quiry on him. For he was ever their quarrel, the way19
475 they would see themselves, everybug his bodiment atop of20
475 annywom her notion, and the meet of their noght was worth two21
475 of his morning. Up to the esker ridge it was, Mallinger parish, to a22
475 mead that was not far, the son's rest. First klettered Shanator23
475 Gregory, seeking spoor through the deep timefield, Shanator24
475 Lyons, trailing the wavy line of his partition footsteps (some-25
475 thing in his blisters was telling him all along how he had26
475 been in that place one time), then his Recordership, Dr Shuna-27
475 dure Tarpey, caperchasing after honourable sleep, hot on to the28
475 aniseed and, up out of his prompt corner, old Shunny MacShunny,29
475 MacDougal the hiker, in the rere of them on the run, to make a30
475 quorum. Roping their ass he was, their skygrey globetrotter,31
475 by way of an afterthought and by no means legless either for32
475 such sprouts on him they were that much oneven it was tumbling33
475 he was by four lengths, within the bawl of a mascot, kuss yuss,34
475 kuss cley, patsy watsy, like the kapr in the kabisses, the big ass,35
475 to hear with his unaided ears the harp in the air, the bugle36
476 dianablowing, wild as wild, the mockingbird whose word is1
476 misfortune, so 'tis said, the bulbul down the wind.2
476        The proto was traipsing through the tangle then, Mathew 3
476 Walker, godsons' goddestfar, deputising for gossipocracy,4
476 and his station was a few perch to the weatherside of the5
476 knoll Asnoch and it was from no other place unless there, how6
476 and ever, that he proxtended aloof upon the ether Mesmer's7
476 Manuum, the hand making silence. The buckos beyond on the lea,8
476 then stopped wheresoever they found their standings and that way9
476 they set ward about him, doing obedience, nod, bend, bow and10
476 curtsey, like the watchers of Prospect, upholding their broad-11
476 awake prober's hats on their firrum heads, the travelling court on12
476 its findings circuiting that personer in his fallen. And a crack quat-13
476 youare of stenoggers they made of themselves, solons and psy-14
476 chomorers, all told, with their hurts and daimons, spites and15
476 clops, not even to the seclusion of their beast by them that was16
476 the odd trick of the pack, trump and no friend of carrots. And,17
476 what do you think, who should be laying there above all other18
476 persons forenenst them only Yawn! All of asprawl he was laying19
476 too amengst the poppies and, I can tell you something more than20
476 that, drear writer, profoundly as you may bedeave to it, he was21
476 oscasleep asleep. And it was far more similar to a satrap he lay there22
476 with unctuous beauty all surrounded, the poser, or for whatall I23
476 know like Lord Lumen, coaching his preferred constellations in24
476 faith and doctrine, for old Matt Gregory, 'tis he had the starmenag-25
476 erie, Marcus Lyons and Lucas Metcalfe Tarpey and the mack26
476 that never forgave the ass that lurked behind him, Jonny na27
476 Hossaleen.28
476        More than their good share of their five senses ensorcelled 29
476 you would say themselves were, fuming censor, the way they30
476 could not rightly tell their heels from their stools as they cooched31
476 down a mamalujo by his cubical crib, as question time drew32
476 nighing and the map of the souls' groupography rose in relief33
476 within their quarterings, to play tops or kites or hoops or marbles,34
476 curchycurchy, gawking on him, for the issuance of his pnum and35
476 softnoising one of them to another one, the boguaqueesthers.36
477 And it is what they began to say to him tetrahedrally then, the1
477 masters, what way was he.2
477                He's giving, the wee bairn. Yun has lived. 3
477                Yerra, why dat, my leader? 4
477                Wisha, is he boosed or what, alannah? 5
477                Or his wind's from the wrong cut, says Ned of the Hill. 6
477                Lesten! 7
477                Why so and speak up, do you hear me, you sir? 8
477                Or he's rehearsing somewan's funeral. 9
477                Whisht outathat! Hubba's up! 10
477        And as they were spreading abroad on their octopuds their 11
477 drifter nets, the chromous gleamy seiners' nets and,no lie, there was12
477 word of assonance being softspoken among those quartermasters.13
477                Get busy, kid! 14
477                Chirpy, come now! 15
477                The present hospices is a good time. 16
477                I'll take on that chap. 17
477        For it was in the back of their mind's ear, temptive lissomer, 18
477 how they would be spreading in quadriliberal their azurespotted19
477 fine attractable nets, their nansen nets, from Matt Senior to the20
477 thurrible mystagogue after him and from thence to the neighbour21
477 and that way to the puisny donkeyman and his crucifer's cauda.22
477 And in their minds years backslibris, so it was, slipping beauty,23
477 how they would be meshing that way, when he rose to it, with24
477 the planckton at play about him, the quivers of scaly silver and25
477 their clutches of chromes of the highly lucid spanishing gold26
477 whilst, as hour gave way to mazing hour, with Yawn himself27
477 keeping time with his thripthongue, to ope his blurbeous lips he28
477 would, a let out classy, the way myrrh of the moor and molten29
477 moonmist would be melding mellifond indo his mouth.30

489                My dear sir! In this wireless age any owl rooster can peck 36
490 up bostoons. But whoewaxed he so anquished? Was he vector1
490 victored of victim vexed?2
490                Mighty sure! Way way for his wehicul! A parambolator 3
490 ram into his bagsmall when he was reading alawd, with two eco-4
490 lites and he's been failing of that kink in his arts over sense.5
490                Madonagh and Chiel, idealist leading a double life! But who, 6
490 for the brilliance of brothers,is the Nolan as appearant nominally?7
490                Mr Nolan is pronuminally Mr Gottgab. 8
490                I get it. By hearing his thing about a person one begins to 9
490 place him for a certain in true. You reeker, he stands pat for10
490 you before a direct object in the feminine. I see. By maiden11
490 sname. Now, I am earnestly asking you, and putting it as12
490 between this yohou and that houmonymh, will just you search13
490 through your gabgut memoirs for all of two minutes for this14
490 impersonating pronolan, fairhead on foulshoulders. Would it be15
490 in twofold truth an untaken mispatriate, too fullfully true and16
490 rereally a doblinganger much about your own medium with a17
490 sandy whiskers? Poke me nabs in the ribs and pick the erstwort18
490 out of his mouth.19
490                Treble Stauter of Holy Baggot Street, formerly Sword- 20
490 meat, who I surpassed him lately for four and six bringing home21
490 the Christmas, as heavy as music, hand to eyes on the peer for22
490 Noel's Arch, in blessed foster's place is doing the dirty on me23
490 with his tantrums and all these godforgiven kilowatts I'd be24
490 better off without. She's write to him she's levt by me, Jenny25
490 Rediviva! Toot! Detter for you, Mr Nobru. Toot toot! Better for26
490 you, Mr Anol! This is the way we. Of a redtettetterday morning.27
490                When your contraman from Tuwarceathay is looking for 28
490 righting that is not a good sign? Not?29
490                I speak truly, it's a shower sign that it's not.  30
490                What though it be for the sow of his heart? If even she 31
490 were a good pool Pegeen?32
490                If she ate your windowsill you wouldn't say sow. 33
490                Would you be surprised after that my asking have you a 34
490 bull, a bosbully, with a whistle in his tail to scare other birds?35
490                I would. 36
491                Were you with Sindy and Sandy attending Goliath, a bull? 1
491                You'd make me sag what you like to. I was intending a 2
491 funeral. Simply and samply.3
491                They are too wise of solbing their silbings? 4
491                And both croon to the same theme. 5
491                Tugbag is Baggut's, when a crispin sokolist besoops juts 6
491 kamps or clapperclaws an irvingite offthedocks. A luckchange, I7
491 see. Thinking young through the muddleage spread, the moral8
491 fat his mental leans on. We can cop that with our straat that is9
491 called corkscrewed. It would be the finest boulevard billy for a10
491 mile in every direction, from Lismore to Cape Brendan, Patrick's,11
491 if they took the bint out of the mittle of it. You told of a tryst12
491 too, two a tutu. I wonder now, without releasing seeklets of the13
491 alcove, turturs or raabraabs, have I heard mention of whose name14
491 anywhere? Mallowlane or Demaasch? Strike us up either end15

502 delugium stramens. One expects that kind of rimey feeling in the30

503                Is it a place fairly exspoused to the four last winds? 18
503                Well, I faithly sincerely believe so indeed if all what I hope 19

506 and herring before the climber clomb aloft, doing the midhill of2
506 the park, flattering his bitter hoolft with her conconundrums.3
506 He would let us have the three barrels. Such was a bitte too thikke4
506 for the Muster of the hoose so as he called down on the Grand5

506 thundered at him to flatch down off that erection and be aslimed7

506 threwed her pippin's thereabouts and they've cropped up tooth25
506 oneydge with hates to leaven this socried isle. Now, thornyborn,26
506 follow the spotlight,please!Concerning a boy. Are you acquainted27
506 with a pagany, vicariously known as Toucher 'Thom' who is. I28
506 suggest Finoglam as his habitat. Consider yourself on the stand29
506 now and watch your words, take my advice. Let your motto be:30
506 Inter nubila numbum.31
506                Never you mind about my mother or her hopitout. I con- 32
506 sider if I did, I would feel frightfully ashamed of admired vice.33
506                He is a man of around fifty, struck on Anna Lynsha's 34
506 Pekoe with milk and whisky, who does messuages and has more35
506 dirt on him than an old dog has fleas, kicking stones and knocking36
507 snow off walls. Have you ever heard of this old boy "Thom" or1
507 "Thim" of the fishy stare who belongs to Kimmage, a crofting dis-2
507 trict, and is not all there, and is all the more himself since he is3
507 not so, being most of his time down at the Green Man where he4
507 steals,pawns,belches and is a curse, drinking gaily two hours after5
507 closing time, with the coat on him skinside out against rappari-6
507 tions, with his socks outsewed his springsides, clapping his hands7
507 in a feeble sort of way and systematically mixing with the public8
507 going for groceries, slapping greats and littlegets soundly with9
507 his cattegut belts, flapping baresides and waltzywembling about10
507 in his accountrements always in font of the tubbernuckles, like11
507 a longarmed lugh, when he would be finished with his tea?12
507                Is it that fellow? As mad as the brambles he is. Touch him. 13
507 With the lawyers sticking to his trewsershins and the swatme-14
507 notting on the basque of his beret. He has kissed me more than15
507 once, I am sorry to say and if I did commit gladrolleries may the16
507 loone forgive it! O wait till I tell you!17
507                We are not going yet. 18
507                And look here! Here's, my dear, what he done, as snooks 19
507 as I am saying so!20
507                Get out, you dirt! A strangely striking part of speech for 21
507 the hottest worked word of ur sprogue. You're not! Unhindered22
507 and odd times? Mere thumbshow? Lately?23
507                How do I know? Such my billet. Buy a barrack pass. Ask 24
507 the horneys. Tell the robbers.25
507                You are alluding to the picking pockets in Lower O'Connell 26
507 Street?27
507                I am illuding to the Pekin packet but I am eluding from 28
507 Laura Connor's treat.29
507                Now, just wash and brush up your memoirias a little bit. 30
507 So I find, referring to the pater of the present man, an erely de-31
507 mented brick thrower, I am wondering to myself in my mind,32
507  qua  our arc of the covenant, was Toucher, a methodist, whose33
507 name, as others say, is not really 'Thom', was this salt son of a34
507 century from Boaterstown, Shivering William, the sealiest old for-35
507 ker ever hawked crannock, who is always with him at the Big Elm36
508 and the Arch after his teeth were shaken out of their suckets by the1

508                Well, I hope the two Collinses don't leg a bail to shoot him. 32
508                Both were white in black arpists at cloever spilling, knickt? 33
508                Gels bach, I, languised, liszted. Etoudies for the right hand. 34
508                Were they now? And were they watching you as watcher 35
508 as well?36
509                Where do you get that wash? This representation does not 1

509 watching. Vechers all.3
509                Good. Hold that watching brief and keep this witching 4

509 gather much from what he let drop? We are sitting here for that.6
509                I was rooshian mad, no lie. About his shapeless hat. 7
509                I suspect you must have been. 8
509                You are making your thunderous mistake. But I was dung 9
509 sorry for him too.10
509                O Schaum! Not really? Were you sorry you were mad 11
509 with him then?12
509                When I tell you I was rooshiamarodnimad with myself 13
509 altogether, so I was, for being sorry for him.14
509                So? 15
509                Absolutely. 16
509                Would you blame him at all stages? 17
509                I believe in many an old stager. But what seemed sooth to 18

515                Were you or were you not? Ask yourself the answer, I'm 19
515 not giving you a short question. Now, not to mix up, cast your20

515 Haywarden. Pitcher cup, patcher cap, pratey man? Be nice about35
515 it, Bones Minor! Look chairful! Come, delicacy!  Go to the end,36
516 thou slackerd! Once upon a grass and a hopping high grass it1
516 was.2
516                Faith, then, Meesta Cheeryman, first he come up, a gag 3
516 as a gig, badgeler's rake to the town's major from the wesz,4
516 MacSmashall Swingy of the Cattelaxes, got up regardless, with5
516 a cock on the Kildare side of his Tattersull, in his riddlesneek's6

516 that foxy freak on his bear's hairs like fire bursting out of the14
516 Ump pyre and, half hang me, sirr, if he wasn't wanting his15

516 Then, begor, counting as many as eleven to thritytwo seconds17
516 with his pocket browning, like I said, wann swanns wann, this is18

516 he wanted with him new nothing about.30
516                A sarsencruxer, like the Nap O' Farrell Patter Tandy moor 31

516 manner of men which I must and will say seems extraordinary,34
516 their celicolar subtler angelic warfare or photoplay finister35

519 mass, with forty ducks indulgent, that some rain was promised32
519 to Mrs Lyons, the invalid of Aunt Tarty Villa, with lots gulp33

520 was to pipe up and saluate that clergyman and to tell his holiness11
520 the whole goat's throat about the three shillings in the confusional12
520 and to say how Mrs Lyons, the cuptosser, was the infidel who13
520 prophessised to pose three shielings Peter's pelf off her tocher14

522                Gently, gently Northern Ire! Love that red hand! Let me 4
522 once more. There are sordidly tales within tales, you clearly5
522 understand that? Now my other point. Did you know, whether6
522 by melanodactylism or purely libationally, that one of these two7
522 Crimeans with the fender, the taller man, was accused of a cer-8
522 tain offence or of a choice of two serious charges, as skirts were9
522 divided on the subject, if you like it better that way? You did,10
522 you rogue, you?11
522                You hear things. Besides (and serially now) bushes have 12
522 eyes, don't forget. Hah!13
522                Which moral turpitude would you select of the two, for 14
522 choice, if you had your way? Playing bull before shebears or the15
522 hindlegs off a clotheshorse? Did any orangepeelers or green-16
522 goaters appear periodically up your sylvan family tree?17
522                Buggered if I know! It all depends on how much family 18
522 silver you want for a nass-and-pair. Hah!19
522                What do you mean, sir, behind your hah! You don't hah 20

522                Nothing, sir. Only a bone moving into place. Blotogaff. 22
522 Hahah!23
522                Whahat? 24
522                Are you to have all the pleasure quizzing on me? I didn't 25
522 say it aloud, sir. I have something inside of me talking to myself.26
522                You're a nice third degree witness, faith! But this is no 27
522 laughing matter. Do you think we are tonedeafs in our noses to28
522 boot? Can you not distinguish the sense, prain, from the sound,29
522 bray? You have homosexual catheis of empathy between narcis-30

562 and they seem to be so tightly tattached as two maggots to touch21
562 other, I think I notice, do I not? You do. Our bright bull babe22
562 Frank Kevin is on heartsleeveside. Do not you waken him ! Our23
562 farheard bode. He is happily to sleep, limb of the Lord, with his24
562 lifted in blessing, his buchel Iosa, like the blissed angel he looks so25
562 like and his mou is semiope as though he were blowdelling on a26
562 bugigle. Whene'er I see those smiles in eyes 'tis Father Quinn27
562 again. Very shortly he will smell sweetly when he will hear a weird28
562 to wean. By gorgeous,that boy will blare some knight when he will29
562 take his dane's pledges and quit our ingletears, spite of undesirable30
562 parents, to wend him to Amorica to quest a cashy job. That keen31
562 dean with his veen nonsolance! O, I adore the profeen music!32
562 Dollarmighty! He is too audorable really, eunique! I guess to33
562 have seen somekid like him in the story book, guess I met some-34
562 where somelam to whom he will be becoming liker. But hush!35
562 How unpardonable of me! I beg for your venials, sincerely I do.36
563       Hush! The other, twined on codliverside, has been crying in 1
563 his sleep, making sharpshape his inscissors on some first choice2
563 sweets fished out of the muck. A stake in our mead. What a3
563 teething wretch! How his book of craven images! Here are post-4
563 humious tears on his intimelle. And he has pipettishly bespilled5
563 himself from his foundingpen as illspent from inkinghorn. He is6
563 jem job joy pip poo pat (jot um for a sobrat!) Jerry Jehu. You will7
563 know him by name in the capers but you cannot see whose heel he8
563 sheepfolds in his wrought hand because I have not told it to you.9
563 O, foetal sleep! Ah, fatal slip! the one loved, the other left, the10
563 bride of pride leased to the stranger! He will be quite within the pale11
563 when with lordbeeron brow he vows him so tosset to be of the sir12
563 Blake tribes bleak while through life's unblest he rodes backs of13
563 bannars. Are you not somewhat bulgar with your bowels?14
563 Whatever do you mean with bleak? With pale blake I write tint-15
563 ingface. O, you do? And with steelwhite and blackmail I ha'scint16
563 for my sweet an anemone's letter with a gold of my bridest hair17
563 betied. Donatus his mark, address as follows. So you did? From18
563 the Cat and Cage. O, I see and see! In the ink of his sweat19
563 he will find it yet. What Gipsy Devereux vowed to Lylian and20
563 why the elm and how the stone. You never may know in the21
563 preterite all perhaps that you would not believe that you ever22
563 even saw to be about to. Perhaps. But they are two very blizky23
563 little portereens after their bredscrums, Jerkoff and Eatsup, as24
563 for my part opinion indeed. They would be born so, costarred,25
563 puck and prig, the maryboy at Donnybrook Fair, the godolphing-26
563 lad in the Hoy's Court. How frilled one shall be as at taledold of27
563 Formio and Cigalette! What folly innocents! Theirs whet pep of28
563 puppyhood! Both barmhearts shall become yeastcake by their29
563 brackfest. I will to leave a my copperwise blessing between the30
563 pair of them, for rosengorge, for greenafang. Blech and tin soldies,31
563 weals in a sniffbox. Som's wholed, all's parted. Weeping shouldst32

564       Jeminy, what is the view which now takes up a second posi- 1
564 tion of discordance, tell it please? Mark! You notice it in that2
564 rereway because the male entail partially eclipses the femecovert.3
564 It is so called for its discord the meseedo. Do you ever heard the4
564 story about Helius Croesus, that white and gold elephant in our5
564 zoopark? You astonish me by it. Is it not that we are command-6
564 ing from fullback, woman permitting, a profusely fine birdseye7
564 view from beauhind this park? Finn his park has been much the8
564 admiration of all the stranger ones, grekish and romanos, who9
564 arrive to here. The straight road down the centre (see relief map)10
564 bisexes the park which is said to be the largest of his kind in the11
564 world. On the right prominence confronts you the handsome12

572       Let us consider. 18
572       The procurator Interrogarius Mealterum presends us this pro- 19
572 poser.20
572       Honuphrius is a concupiscent exservicemajor who makes dis- 21
572 honest propositions to all. He is considered to have committed,22
572 invoking droit d'oreiller, simple infidelities with Felicia, a virgin,23
572 and to be practising for unnatural coits with Eugenius and Jere-24
572 mias, two or three philadelphians. Honophrius, Felicia, Eugenius25
572 and Jeremias are consanguineous to the lowest degree. Anita26
572 the wife of Honophrius, has been told by her tirewoman, For-27
572 tissa, that Honuphrius has blasphemously confessed under volun-28
572 tary chastisement that he has instructed his slave, Mauritius, to29
572 urge Magravius, a commercial, emulous of Honuphrius, to solicit30
572 the chastity of Anita. Anita is informed by some illegitimate31
572 children of Fortissa with Mauritius (the supposition is Ware's)32
572 that Gillia, the schismatical wife of Magravius, is visited clandes-33
572 tinely by Barnabas, the advocate of Honuphrius, an immoral34
572 person who has been corrupted by Jeremias. Gillia, (a cooler35
572 blend, D'Alton insists) ex equo with Poppea, Arancita, Clara,36
573 Marinuzza, Indra and Iodina, has been tenderly debauched1
573 (in Halliday's view), by Honuphrius, and Magravius knows2
573 from spies that Anita has formerly committed double sacrilege3
573 with Michael, vulgo Cerularius, a perpetual curate, who wishes4
573 to seduce Eugenius. Magravius threatens to have Anita molested5
573 by Sulla, an orthodox savage (and leader of a band of twelve6
573 mercenaries, the Sullivani), who desires to procure Felicia for7
573 Gregorius, Leo, Vitellius and Macdugalius, four excavators, if8
573 she will not yield to him and also deceive Honuphrius by ren-9
573 dering conjugal duty when demanded. Anita who claims to have10
573 discovered incestuous temptations from Jeremias and Eugenius11
573 would yield to the lewdness of Honuphrius to appease the12
573 savagery of Sulla and the mercernariness of the twelve Sullivani,13
573 and (as Gilbert at first suggested), to save the virginity of14
573 Felicia for Magravius when converted by Michael after the15
573 death of Gillia, but she fears that, by allowing his marital rights16
573 she may cause reprehensible conduct between Eugenius and17
573 Jeremias. Michael, who has formerly debauched Anita, dispen-18
573 ses her from yielding to Honuphrius who pretends publicly to19
573 possess his conjunct in thirtynine several manners (turpiter!20
573 affirm ex cathedris Gerontes Cambronses) for carnal hygiene21
573 whenever he has rendered himself impotent to consummate by22
573 subdolence. Anita is disturbed but Michael comminates that23
573 he will reserve her case tomorrow for the ordinary Guglielmus24
573 even if she should practise a pious fraud during affrication25
573 which, from experience, she knows (according to Wadding),26
573 to be leading to nullity. Fortissa, however, is encouraged by27
573 Gregorius, Leo, Viteilius, and Magdugalius, reunitedly, to warn28
573 Anita by describing the strong chastisements of Honuphrius29
573 and the depravities (turpissimas!) of Canicula, the deceased wife30
573 of Mauritius, with Sulla, the simoniac, who is abnegand and31
573 repents. Has he hegemony and shall she submit?32
573       Translate a lax, you breed a bradaun. In the goods of Cape and 33

573       This, lay readers and gentilemen, is perhaps the commonest 35
573 of all cases arising out of umbrella history in connection with36
574 the wood industries in our courts of litigation. D'Oyly Owens1
574 holds (though Finn Magnusson of himself holds also) that so2
574 long as there is a joint deposit account in the two names a3
574 mutual obligation is posited. Owens cites Brerfuchs and Warren,4
574 a foreign firm, since disseized, registered as Tangos, Limited,5
574 for the sale of certain proprietary articles. The action which was6
574 at the instance of the trustee of the heathen church emergency7
574 fund, suing by its trustee, a resigned civil servant, for the pay-8
574 ment of tithes due was heard by Judge Doyle and also by a com-9
574 mon jury. No question arose as to the debt for which vouchers10
574 spoke volumes. The defence alleged that payment had been made11
574 effective. The fund trustee, one Jucundus Fecundus Xero Pecun-12
574 dus Coppercheap, counterclaimed that payment was invalid13
574 having been tendered to creditor under cover of a crossed cheque,14
574 signed in the ordinary course, in the name of Wieldhelm, Hurls15
574 Cross, voucher copy provided, and drawn by the senior partner16
574 only by whom the lodgment of the species had been effected but17
574 in their joint names. The bank particularised, the national misery18
574 (now almost entirely in the hands of the four chief bondholders19
574 for value in Tangos), declined to pay the draft, though there20
574 were ample reserves to meet the liability, whereupon the trusty21
574 Coppercheap negociated it for and on behalf of the fund of the22
574 thing to a client of his, a notary, from whom, on consideration, he23
574 received in exchange legal relief as between trusthee and bethrust,24
574 with thanks. Since then the cheque, a good washable pink, em-25
574 bossed D you D No 11 hundred and thirty 2, good for the figure26
574 and face, had been circulating in the country for over thirtynine27
574 years among holders of Pango stock, a rival concern, though not28
574 one demonetised farthing had ever spun or fluctuated across the29
574 counter in the semblance of hard coin or liquid cash. The jury (a30
574 sour dozen of stout fellows all of whom were curiously named31
574 after doyles) naturally disagreed jointly and severally, and the32
574 belligerent judge, disagreeing with the allied jurors' disagree-33
574 ment, went outside his jurisfiction altogether and ordered a gar-34
574 nishee attachment to the neutral firm.  No mandamus could lo-35
574 cate the depleted whilom Breyfawkes as he had entered into an36
575 ancient moratorium, dating back to the times of the early barters,1
575 and only the junior partner Barren could be found, who entered an2
575 appearance and turned up, upon a notice of motion and after service3
575 of the motion by interlocutory injunction, among the male jurors4
575 to be an absolete turfwoman, originally from the proletarian class,5
575 with still a good title to her sexname of Ann Doyle, 2 Coppinger's6
575 Cottages, the Doyle's country. Doyle (Ann), add woman in,7
575 having regretfully left the juryboxers, protested cheerfully on the8
575 stand in a long jurymiad in re corset checks, delivered in doy-9
575 lish, that she had often, in supply to brusk demands rising almost10
575 to bollion point, discounted Mr Brakeforth's first of all in ex-11

575 dorse, adhesively, to her various payers-drawers who in most cases18
575 were identified by the timber papers as wellknown tetigists of the19
575 city and suburban. The witness, at her own request, asked if she20
575 might and wrought something between the sheets of music paper21
575 which she had accompanied herself with for the occasion and22
575 this having been handed up for the bench to look at in camera,23
575 Coppinger's doll, as she was called, (annias, Mack Erse's Dar,24
575 the adopted child) then proposed to jerrykin and jureens and every25

575 he seemed to proffer the steadiest interest towards her, but this31
575 prepoposal was ruled out on appeal by Judge Jeremy Doyler, who,32
575 reserving judgment in a matter of courts and reversing the find-33

575 fending the dissassents of the pickpackpanel, twelve as upright35

576 supremely that, as no property in law can exist in a corpse,5

589 his parsonfired wicket, showing all shapes of striplings in sleepless24
589 tights. Promptly whomafter in undated times, very properly a25
589 dozen generations anterior to themselves, a main chanced to burst26
589 and misflooded his fortunes, wrothing foulplay over his fives'27
589 court and his fine poultryyard wherein were spared a just two of28
589 a feather in wading room only. Next, upon due reflotation, up29
589 started four hurrigan gales to smithereen his plateglass house-30
589 walls and the slate for accounts his keeper was cooking. Then31
589 came three boy buglehorners who counterbezzled and cross-32
589 bugled him. Later on in the same evening two hussites ab-33
589 sconded through a breach in his bylaws and left him, the infidels,34
589 to pay himself off in kind remembrances. Till, ultimatehim, fell35
589 the crowning barleystraw, when an explosium of his distilleries36

619 Unless? Away! Rise up, man of the hooths, you have slept so25

621 Until it's the time. And me and you have made our. The sons of10
621 bursters won in the games. Still I'll take me owld Finvara for my11

621 Reach down. A lil mo. So. Draw back your glave. Hot and hairy,24

621 an infams. One time you told you'd been burnt in ice. And one26
621 time it was chemicalled after you taking a lifeness. Maybe that's27
621 why you hold your hodd as if. And people thinks you missed the28

621 a youth in his florizel, a boy in innocence, peeling a twig, a child be-30

622 foddy! You'll crush me antilopes I saved so long for. They're9
622 Penisole's. And the two goodiest shoeshoes. It is hardly a Knut's10

622 Afartodays, afeartonights, and me as with you in thadark. You15

624 up by Brostal because your parents would be always tumbling33
624 into his foulplace and losing her pentacosts after drinking their34
624 pledges? Howsomendeavour, you done me fine! The only man35
624 was ever known could eat the crushts of lobsters. Our native36
625 night when you twicetook me for some Marienne Sherry and1
625 then your Jermyn cousin who signs hers with exes and the beard-2
625 wig I found in your Clarksome bag. Pharaops you'll play you're3
625 the king of Aeships. You certainly make the most royal of noises.4
625 I will tell you all sorts of makeup things, strangerous. And show5
625 you to every simple storyplace we pass. Cadmillersfolly, Bellevenue,6
625 Wellcrom, Quid Superabit, villities valleties. Change the plates7
625 for the next course of murphies! Spendlove's still there and the8
625 canon going strong and so is Claffey's habits endurtaking and9
625 our parish pomp's a great warrent. But you'll have to ask that10
625 same four that named them is always snugging in your bar-11
625 salooner, saying they're the best relicts of Conal O'Daniel and12
625 writing Finglas since the Flood.  That'll be some kingly work in pro-13
625 gress. But it's by this route he'll come some morrow. And I14
625 can signal you all flint and fern are rasstling as we go by. And15
625 you'll sing thumb a bit and then wise your selmon on it. It is all16
625 so often and still the same to me. Snf? Only turf, wick dear! Clane17
625 turf. You've never forgodden batt on tarf, have you, at broin18
625 burroow, what? Mch? Why, them's the muchrooms, come up19
625 during the night. Look, agres of roofs in parshes. Dom on dam,20
625 dim in dym. And a capital part for olympics to ply at. Steadyon,21
625 Cooloosus! Mind your stride or you'll knock. While I'm dodging22
625 the dustbins. Look what I found! A lintil pea. And look at here!23
625 This cara weeseed. Pretty mites, my sweetthings, was they poor-24
625 loves abandoned by wholawidey world? Neighboulotts for new-25

625 said. It fair takes. If I lose my breath for a minute or two don't28
625 speak, remember! Once it happened, so it may again. Why I'm29
625 all these years within years in soffran, allbeleaved. To hide away30
625 the tear, the parted. It's thinking of all. The brave that gave their.31
625 The fair that wore. All them that's gunne. I'll begin again in a32
625 jiffey. The nik of a nad. How glad you'll be I waked you! My!33
625 How well you'll feel! For ever after. First we turn by the vagurin34
625 here and then it's gooder. So side by side, turn agate, wedding-35
625 town, laud men of Londub! I only hope whole the heavens sees36
626 us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Anna-1

626 tider. Allgearls is wea. At times. So. While you're adamant evar.3
626 Wrhps, that wind as if out of norewere! As on the night of the4
626 Apophanypes. Jumpst shootst throbbst into me mouth like a5
626 bogue and arrohs! Ludegude of the Lashlanns, how he whips6
626 me cheeks! Sea, sea! Here, weir, reach, island, bridge. Where you7
626 meet I. The day. Remember! Why there that moment and us8
626 two only? I was but teen, a tiler's dot. The swankysuits was9
626 boosting always, sure him, he was like to me fad. But the swag-10
626 gerest swell off Shackvulle Strutt. And the fiercest freaky ever11
626 followed a pining child round the sluppery table with a forkful12
626 of fat. But a king of whistlers. Scieoula! When he'd prop me atlas13
626 against his goose and light our two candles for our singers duohs14
626 on the sewingmachine. I'm sure he squirted juice in his eyes to15
626 make them flash for flightening me. Still and all he was awful16
626 fond to me. Who'll search for Find Me Colours now on the hilly-17
626 droops of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued's tale that while18
626 blubles blows there'll still be sealskers. There'll be others but non 19
626 so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after20
626 night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you'd21
626 stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of  22
626 branches for to fan me coolly. And I'd lie as quiet as a moss. And23
626 one time you'd rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black 24
626 shadow with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I'd frozen25
626 up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone26
626 then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy's Vulking27
626 Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you28
626 looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost29
626 now. How? How you said how you'd give me the keys of me30
626 heart. And we'd be married till delth to uspart. And though dev31
626 do espart. O mine! Only, no, now it's me who's got to give. As32
626 duv herself div. Inn this linn. And can it be it's nnow fforvell?33
626 Illas! I wisht I had better glances to peer to you through this bay-34
626 light's growing. But you're changing, acoolsha, you're changing35
626 from me, I can feel. Or is it me is? I'm getting mixed. Brightening36
627 up and tightening down. Yes, you're changing, sonhusband, and1
627 you're turning, I can feel you, for a daughterwife from the hills2
627 again. Imlamaya. And she is coming. Swimming in my hindmoist.3
627 Diveltaking on me tail. Just a whisk brisk sly spry spink spank4
627 sprint of a thing theresomere, saultering. Saltarella come to her5
627 own. I pity your oldself I was used to. Now a younger's there.6
627 Try not to part! Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she'll7
627 be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me8
627 mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud.9
627 In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only.10
627 It's something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain11
627 now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her12
627 rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Think-13
627 ing always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and14
627 is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of15
627 the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now16
627 they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little17
627 warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the18
627 greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy19
627 leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it's all! And me20
627 letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought21
627 you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You're only22
627 a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in23
627 glory. You're but a puny. Home!  My people were not their sort24
627 out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and25
627 bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild26
627 dances in all their wild din. I can seen meself among them, alla-27
627 niuvia pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia,28
627 when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird,29
627 haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For30
627 'tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of31
627 our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed32
627 of your name! But I'm loothing them that's here and all I lothe.33
627 Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O34
627 bitter ending!  I'll slip away before they're up. They'll never see.35
627 Nor know. Nor miss me. And it's old and old it's sad and old it's36
628 sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold
